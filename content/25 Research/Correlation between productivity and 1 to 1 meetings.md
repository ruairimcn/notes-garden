# Leadership training to improve meetings
**Source:** Time is Ltd whitepaper, 'Leadership Training'

Time Is Ltd. worked with a tech company to increase staff productivity and satisfaction, and to reduce staff turnover.
The company is a fast-growth, high profit tech company with 3,500 employees, four offices across four continents, high salaries, flex hours, free yoga classes, etc.
Despite this
- One third of staff were 'dissatisfied with the overall employee experience'.
- Voluntary staff turnover was more than 20% after a year of employment. [According to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2018/06/29/the-real-problem-with-tech-professionals-high-turnover/?sh=1bd5c4cd4201) the tech industry average is already the highest at 13.2%
- One fifth of employees got 1's and 2's on a 5 point scale in their annual appraisals.


## Analysing the data
Time is Ltd requested the company's communication data, including
- team meetings
- 1:1 meetings
- emails
- instant messaging
- video calls


They corralated this with employee surveys, retention, and performance evaluation. 

**The key finding was a distinct correlation between the time managers spent with their direct reports in. 1:1's to the subortinates' performance, retention, and engagement. The strongest correlation was between 1:1 meetings and engagement.**


Average number of montly 1:1 manager:direct report meetings:  0.7

Median time managers spent with direct reports each month: 18 minutes.

When managers spent at least 20 minutes of 1:1 time per week with direct reports, those employees were
27% more engaged according to the employee survey
19% less likely to leave the company
14% higher in their performance reviews 



## Boosting the 1:1 metric:
- C-Suite made their calendars available so employees could see increased frequency of 1:1 meetings. Managers were encouraged to to the same.
- CEO-led info campaign to encourage employees to ask direct managers for 1:1 meetings
- Targeted manager training held on the significance of feedback
- 1:1 meeting benchmarks became KPIs for managers


After 12 months it was found that each extra 10 minutes spent in 1:1 meetings above pre-intervention baseline raised the overall level of employee engagement, decreased turnover by 18%, and increased employee satisfaction in surveys by 14%.
