Below is a non-exhaustive list of service-based industries from Wikipedia.
I will explore (mostly using my own experience) how much technology and communication is involved in each. 

I will also rate each on a scale of 1 to 10 for how 'knowledge based' each one is based on these criteria from [[Knowledge Worker Productivity by GSA]]:
