Having read further in I'm not sure if this paper will be useful as it seems to focus only on
- Airlines
- General-merchandise retailing
- Restaurants
- Retail banking
- Telecom

likely since this paper was published in 1992.

*'We focused on productivity because it is the most fundamental measure of economic performance. Productivity is the ratio between the output of goods and services and the input of resources used to produce them. On a national basis, productivity is an important indicator of a country’s economic strength. Regardless of national employment levels, the higher the productivity, the higher the living standards. Increasing productivity is the engine driving economic growth, which in turn provides society with additional goods and services for consumption and investment.'*

This seems to hold true, my other source of this statement being [[How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio]] in which Dalio says there are three main sources of economic growth:
- Productivity increase
- Short-term debt cycle
- Long-term debt cycle
with productivity being best as it doesn't cause cycles.

# Summary
Service industry productive going down has a negative impact on industries that are customers of the service industry: 
*"Improvements in service productivity also have a direct impact on the international competitiveness of manufacturing firms. These firms are customers of the service sector and must be concerned about the price and quality of what they buy. We estimate that the service sector represents about 23 percent of the value of sales of the industrial sector of the US economy. As a result, a productivity disadvantage of, say, 20 percent in services would mean a disadvantage of 4.6 percent (20 percent of 23 percent) of sales cost—a gap that would sharply reduce or even eliminate the profits available to some manufacturing companies from international trade."*
