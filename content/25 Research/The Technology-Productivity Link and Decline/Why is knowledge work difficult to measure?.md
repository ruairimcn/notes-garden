Knowledge work is often intangible and invisible:
- You can't count the number of judgements people make a day.
- It's hard to quantify the value of relationships that people deliver, they often take time to bear fruit/results.
- It's hard to quantify the ideas that are inspired by or generated by knowledge workers.
