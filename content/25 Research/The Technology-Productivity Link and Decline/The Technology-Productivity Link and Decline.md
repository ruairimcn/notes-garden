There is mounting evidence amongst economists that even though we are deploying technology more and more in service based industries (i.e finance, consulting, law etc) productivity is not going up - in many cases it's declining. Why is this?

My initial hypothesis can be found here:
[[Chat tools cause a decrease in productivity]]

My new hypothesis, after doing some further research and reading the book [[The Shallows]], is that
[[Regular, undisciplined use of the internet causes a decrease in the ability to focus]]





# Going Deeper
As of 2nd September 2021, Patrick has read my initial hypothesis and has follow-on questions for me to explore:
- What are the primary or most commonly deployed management practices/theories for knowledge work organizations? 
- Where do the roots of these practices stem from? I am curious to know if they are an outgrowth from manufacturing organizations from the early 20th century or if they are newly developed theories from recent decades. 
- There are a broad range of industries under the umbrella of knowledge work. Which of those industries are more productive and which are less productive?
	For example I would imagine that software development is far more productive than marketing and sales teams. Software development is highly focused on output whereas marketing and sales is dependent on communication, which inevitably creates dependencies and inefficiencies. 
- It would be interesting to dig deep into why some industries/fields of work are more productive than others. Is it because of the tools? Is it because of the training? Is it because of how performance is measured? 
- What are the most common forms of measuring productivity in the services sector?

## Captology 
Is captology part of the problem? Are computers and their software inherently bad for productivity?

# To explore
Ideas that come to me to be explored further

## Avalanche effect 
If 9 people on a team of 10 are organized and communicate well, and 1 is not, I think this will have a negative knock on effect on the other 9 due to the nature of knowledge work.

This would happen on an assembly line but rarely does as it is more streamlined and inefficiency-free than human-centric knowledge work.


## Disadvantage of multiple screens and increased processing power
Discussed here, and relevant to below about reducing friction:

## Disadvantages of reducing friction
I think many issues with communication stem from the reduction in friction for communicating with work colleagues; perhaps reduced friction is not always a good thing?

## Management and communication 
Is over-communication linked to having too many managers?
- Communication is often a big part of a manager's job
- Managers often rely on communication as a metric to measure productivity 
- So having too many managers might cause an avalanche effect where each is vying to prove their worth and thus does more communicating than necessary 



## Lack of Knowledge Management System
It's possible that a lack of knowledge management systems, practices, and workflows is causing a rise in unnecessary communication and hence a decline in productivity.

Communication is the transfer of knowledge/information, so a lack of a central/shared repository of knowledge/info would cause a rise in communication, that could be reduced by creating a good knowledge system. 


## Knowledge VS Information
[[Difference between information and knowledge]]


## Measurement difficulty
[[Why is knowledge work difficult to measure?]]



## Finding the right balance of management
A lack of management of knowledge workers can have a negative impact, as shown in the white paper by [[Time is Ltd]] on [[Correlation between productivity and 1 to 1 meetings]]



## Access to internet
Internet access may be contributing to the problem.
Increased technology does not always mean increased internet connectivity; tellers use till systems, waiters use ordering apps, factory workers use software for interfacing with machines, but these systems don't need internet access; or at least they don't need *unrestricted* internet access; there is a different between a till system connecting to the internet to sync sock, and a sales person having unrestricted access via a web browser. 

Does web browser access decrease productivity?
