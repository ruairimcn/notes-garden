This is my original hypothesis on [[The Technology-Productivity Link and Decline|Why technology can cause a decrease in productivity in the services sector]]

# Hypothesis: Chat/IM Communication Technology is the culprit
Having explored some of the literature on this issue, I see strong evidence that it is specifically **direct, synchronous chat/instant messaging communication and collaboration technology** that is causing productivity to either stall or decline.

I think we can also narrow this down to **communication between knowledge workers.**

**Summary:**
The average time that knowledge workers spend using communication tools has only increased slightly between 18.1% to 18.6% between 2013 and 2019. So Chat/IM tools haven't reduced the total time spent communicating. 

Chat/IM tools are more disruptive to one's attention than email and meetings as they pull away our attention much more frequently due to a higher volume and frequency of messages; *this causes the 25 minute timer to fully restore our focus to be reset more often, and people spend less time in a state of high focus as a result.*


## Contrast to other types of technology
Let us first look at a very different type of work: skilled manual craftsmanship. For this example, we'll take carpentry.

When a carpenter purchases a new tool, he gets immediate feedback as to how well it works. He can compare it to other tools and measure its impact on his work. So it is unlikely that a carpenter will add techology to his workflow that makes him less productive. An angle grinder is either good at what it does or it is not.

How about communication-related technology? This is pretty simple too; a carpenter needs to get leads in, communicate with their client on what they want the end product or service to be, and communicate with suppliers to acquire supplies.
There is also communication with tools and machinery; he might send a CAD (computer-aided design) file to a CNC router that will take the file and cut a specific shape into a block of wood based on that file - also straight forward. 

Carpenters might use apps and services on their phones and their laptops, such as a simple task manager or inventory tracker, however I suspect that they are not losing out on productivity here as **they are aware that every second they spend on a phone or laptop is a second not spent doiung their craft.** (*evidence needed here*) This line is blurred for knowledge workers.

Even if we scale this up to an entire woodworking factory, they are usually well-run, productive enterprises as communication needs are simple and machinery does a lot of the heavy lifting.

Knowledge workers have a tougher time here:
- More communication is required as the machines they have to work and cooperate with are usually the brains of other knowledge workers; their brains are the key production method (Knowledge Worker Productivty, GSA Enterprise Transformation, 2011).
- Compared to physical trades, knowledge work is less standardized and structured, this also applies to how, when, and why communication takes place (Knowledge Worker Productivty, GSA Enterprise Transformation, 2011).

So communcation between knowledge workers is important to the functioning of the business, more complex, high volume, poorly understood, and often unoptimised and unstandardised. 


We now know that communication is much more crucial to knowledge work than other types of work; let's look at how this becomes a problem.


## The Rise of Communication Tools
According to a [Vox investigation on the popular chat tool Slack](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511575/productivity-slack-google-microsoft-facebook), the new wave of communication software, which includes Slack, **has not done what it originally intended to do: replace email.** Most people are still using older methods of communication such as emails and meetings.

> ðŸ’¬  'Productivity software should be something you use less than the thing you used before.' - Sarah Lacy

A possible issue here is that, were Slack to really make knowledge workers more productive, then knowledge workers would end up using Slack less and less. And since engagement usually equates to profit in our modern attention economy, I think it is in Slack's financial interests to keep users engaged with it. 

Vox writes 
"I'm sure email was an extremely productive tool in the beginning. Only over time did it get to be misused. Email eventually suffered from its own abundance. Threads became too long and complicated to parse. People replied-all."

It is likely that knowledge workers, who previously spent large portions of their days in their email apps, were already beyond the point of diminishing returns for communication tool use; if this is indeed the case, what value does Slack bring if total communication time has stayed the same?

![[Productivity and tech, point of diminishing returns.jpeg]]


According to [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/), this is indeed the case: The total amount of time we spend communicating is roughly the same as it was 6 years ago.

RescueTime is a computer/tablet/phone app that tracks the amount of time users spend in certain apps and websites. They aggregate all data and use it to evaluate the current state of software usage, and these stats are cited in this Vox article. 

On average people spend 5.5 hours a day actively focused on screens during the work day.

The below table shows the % of those 5.5 hours spent on each type of communication in 2013 and then 2019 (according to RescueTime. *Unsure of sample size or scope of data*)

| Comms Type | 2013      | 2019      |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| Email      | 13.6      | 10.4      |
| Chat/IM    | 1         | 5.2       |
| Video      | .1        | .5        |
| Voice      | 1.8       | .6        |
| Calendar   | .5        | .7        |
| Other      | 1.1       | 1.2       |
| **Total**  | **18.1 **  | ** 18.6** |
	

So, communication time has increased slightly to 18.6%, for a total of about 1 hour a day. 

Is the increase in Chat/IM time an issue? I believe it is, and this is what makes up the main argument of this hypothesis:
1) We know that [[It takes 25 minutes to fully focus on a task after switching from another]].
2) Chat/IM causes a lot more task switching than email.

If the above are true, then it is highly likely that the stagnation or decrease in productivity is due to Chat/IM tools causing an even greater fracturing of our attention during a working day.

Let's look at evidence for item 2 above.

## Chat/IM tools fracture our attention even more 

The following screenshot is from a white paper by Time Is Ltd. 
This company specialises in improving the productivity of large firms by tracking and analysisng the various communication tools in an organisation, and giving recommendations based on these findings.
They usually find that the overuse and constant checking of communication tools is detrimental to productivity and employee satisfaction.

(Note: below graph is based on one person, and this is a white paper not a research paper so there is likely some bias caused by economic incentives. It's a good starting point but further examples and data are needed.)

![[Time Is Ltd Distraction Frequency.png]]

The graph shows that Slack creates significantly more 'collaboration events' than emails and meetings. If we can show that this is true for most knowledge workers in most industries, we have a solid basis for arguing that **it is specifically Chat/IM tools that are causing a drop in productivity. **


## Why do Chat/IM tools cause this problem?
Here are some possible root causes of this issue:
- Chat/IM tools are better at 'hacking' our inate novelty and reward-seeking behaviour than other communication tools, as 
	1. They are synchronous, so people feel the need to check them constantly due to FOMO - Fear of Missing Out.
	2. [[The Convenience Bias]], or 'The Trap of Convenience'. Chat/IM tools are quicker and easier to use, and this bias causes people to conflate higher convenience with higher productivity and value-creation.
- Chat/IM tools break our focus more often. This weakens our ability to focus over time, making us more susceptible to inattentional bilndness and change blindness (proof needed).
- Chat/IM tools exacerbate the problem of 'ASAP expectations', this was an issue already with emails, with Chat it likely creates a positive feedback loop; it is easier to spend more time in chat apps and to check them more frequently, this shortens the window that is considered 'ASAP' which causes people to check the chat app even more. 



## The wrong solution to the challenge
Businesses are not adopting Chat/IM tools on a whim for no good reason; there is a challenge to be solved here, and according to a white-paper on attention and focus by Time Is Ltd, the challenge is:

> ðŸ’¡ As a result of modern trends and changes, 'on average, we are forced to cooperate with more people, balance more tasks, switch betweem different working spheres, and work with more tools and applications thab ever before. This represents a tough challenge for our attention's ability to successfully manage the allocation of our limited cognitive resources to competing information-processing demands generated by these new workplace conditions.'

These modern trends and changes include
- Workplace digitization
- Workplace globalization
- Remote work
- Gig economy 
- Flexible work schedules


### Why was the wrong solution chosen?
The challenge is real; why are organisations consistently choosing the wrong solution? Some possible answers:

- Chat/IM apps have become 'trendy' and popular, causing greater take-up in the business world. Decision makers may assume that Slack's high valuation (Salesforce purchased Slack for **$27.7 billion** in cash and stock) equates to creating higher productivity in their workplaces.
- [[The Convenience Bias]]/Trap of Convenience tricks decision makers into thinking Slack is raising productivity. 

- The modern trends listed above, combined with the tendancy of many managers to micromanage, has caused three issues discussed in the paper Knowledge Worker Productivty, GSA Enterprise Transformation, 2011:
 
	- Are 'invisible' workers working? Managers worry that they won't be able to tell whether an 'invisible' worker is working or not.
	- How will my manager know what I'm doing? Conversely, invisible/teleworkers worry that their managers may not see the value that they are adding.
	
	- How will my positional status be obvious? Teleworkers are concerned that their positional status will not be recognized if they are not physically present in the office.
	
These issues have now bled into office/non-remote work as well. And unfortunately, in most businesses, the chosen solution to these problems is seen to be an increase in communication, which is being facilitated by Chat/IM tools. **Employees and managers are mistakenly assuming that more time spent in chat/IM tools means higher productivity, creating a positive feedback loop that perpetuates the problem.**

The Vox article mentioned earlier states that 
'Remote workers are under particular strain to prove they are working. For people not in an office, messaging colleagues or posting information becomes a way of demonstrating that they are doing their jobs.' 

The paper goes on to discuss another factor to this problem, which is that most businesses that mostly employ knowledge workers **do not have a good framework for measuring knowledge worker productivity.** And once again, we find that a common chosen solution to this problem is to measure producivity by communication frequency.

There seems to be a lack of [[First Principles Thinking]] here: businesses are choosing to do the common, trendy thing, instead of deploying critical thinking to see if it is actually the best choice. A simple Google search will return thousands of results on why Chat/IM tools like Slack are not conductive to prodcuctivity.

It is also difficult to fix this problem once it has begun, as change gets more and more difficult as businesses get larger.

## Lack of Training and Internal Frameworks
I think a lack of training is contributing to the problem.
In the early days of technology, one had to be highly trained in order to use it and deploy it properly. As an example, one had to be highly trained in order to use early computers as the machines were complex and the barriers to use were high. 
As technology has advanced, complexity has sometimes been lowered, but sometimes it has only **seemingly** been lowered, in that basic use is easy, but effective use takes training and work.

Anyone can work out how to use email or Slack in a few minutes, but using it in a way that increases productivity instead of lowering it takes more effort.

We are giving people new tools and expecting them to figure out how to use them *efficiently.* What I suspect happens is that most people end up using them *inefficiently*; the status quo sans training can end up being a productivity drain instead of a gain.

For example, a few simple changes to email can make it less distracting:
- Install a free plugin that pauses your inbox for certian periods, so that you can read existing emails without being distracted by new ones
- Set up labels and filters to automatically sort and categorise emails, making them easier to retrieve. 
- Turn off notifications, popups, and sounds to avoid email breaking your focus 

These things are not obvious, and usually not taught by the technology's creator or the business that is implementing it.

Furthermore, many businesses seem to lack a framework for how communication technology should be used (proof needed). Sometimes they don't even have official tools to use, resulting in employees using whatever they like to commmunicate. More options means more time spent deliberating between available channels. 

## Amplification of poor work culture
![[The Dark Side of Technology#^3e2c97]]

Tristane is a thought leader in the area of technology and how to harness its good side and reduce its dark side.

I think part of the problem is that there is already a culture of busy-work, constant distractions, and a lack of [[10 Literature Notes/Books/Deep Work]] in many businesses. Technology may be simply amplifying this, in which case the solutions could be
- Fix the core of the problem so that there is only a good culture to be amplified and not a poor one
- Purposefully choose software that doesn't exacerbate the existing cultural problems, set it up in specific ways and train people to use it in specific ways that counter the problem. 

Technology may also be exacerbating the problems caused by poor managers who micro-manage, as with techology they can now get an even deeper look into what their employees are doing, compared to previous decades. They can read emails, track time spent in specific applications, even watch the screens of employees. 

According to the paper 
'Knowledge Worker Productivity: Challenges, Issues, Solutions', June 2011 by GAS Enterprise Transformation,
managers should be trained in productivity and performance management, and businesses should develop a robust but flexible framework for measuring knowledge worker productivity. 
It's possible that these things are not being done in many businesses and that this is a contributing factor to the decline in productivity.

## Lack of awarness of the issue
For a problem to be noticed, stopped in its tracks, and be reversed, people first need to acknowledge it and be aware of it. A contributing factor may be a lack of awareness about how techology often decreases productivity, possibly exacerbated by
[[The Mere-exposure Effect]]:
![[The Mere-exposure Effect#^fc3871]]

Many businesses and their managers might not even be aware of the issue, in which case they can't begin to work out how to fix it. 


## Knock-on effect on other areas
In a survey conducted by the [Economist's business arm](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miscommunications-at-work-impact-the-bottom-line-study-finds-300620637.html), respondents "overwhelmingly indicated that poor communications at work can lead to stressful work environments, stalled careers, missed performance goals, and lost sales.  "

So poor communication may be a double-edged sword; on the one-hand, poor communication in and of itself reduces producivity, and on the otherhand, its negative effect on employee stress and satisfaction levels may also be detrimental to productivity. 


## Productivity increases during a Slack outage
Slack was down for a few hours on 27th June 2018. RescueTime showed that productivity increased (based on their 12,000 users spending more time in 'productive' apps; Twitter VS Excel).
