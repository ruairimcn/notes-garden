**Initial question:**
What are the primary or most commonly deployed management practices/theories for knowledge work organizations? 

# Areas to explore
- Can we learn from universitiers here? They are knowledge work organisations. See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291120300140
	- This article is about knowledge management practices as opposed to management of knowledge workers, not much use.
