The True meeting Cost Formula states that the true cost of a meeting is
**Meeting Time X People in Meeting**

I.E. an hour-long meeting with 10 people is not an hour-long meeting; to the company it is a 10 hour meeting as they are losing out on 10 hours of total employee time that could be spent on core work.
