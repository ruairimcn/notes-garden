This is my current hypothesis as to why [[The Technology-Productivity Link and Decline|Technology can cause a decrease in productivity in the service sector]]


# Initial thoughts
After looking into the link between productivity and chat/IM tools, I began exploring how use of the internet varies in different types of service jobs; the internet is used, but to a much lesser, restricted extent, in jobs like table waiting, fast food, checkout clerk, etc. These professions often used internet-enabled devices, but for very specific, defined tasks; updating stock, sending orders to the kitchen, receiving orders from digital kiosks, etc. And though I don't yet have data to back this up, I believe, from experience, that these professions are not suffering from a lack of productivity as more technology comes on board.

I also thought about how, if these professions do experience a decrease in productivity, it is likely due to their own, personal use of the internet, e.g. checking social media on a phone break, where they now have access to unlimited information.

This led me to suspecting that **unrestricted, undisciplined, unlimited access to the internet is causing a decrease in focus and hence in productivity.**

This brings us to [[The Shallows]].


# The Shallows
Credit to my father who bought and read this book, and mentioned it to me when I was a teenager. It's name rose to my mind, and I bought it and read it in about a week.

While reading it, I had begun conducting a personal experiment where I [[My experiment with keeping the internet off by default|kept the internet off by default]]. I generally kept it turned off from a few hours before bed until 1pm the next day, and when I did turn it on I was much more conscious of it being on, and I henced used it only for the tasks I set out to do.

A few days into this, I noticed my focus had begun to increase; this helped me to read [[The Shallows]] quicker than I would normally read a book of its length and complexity. So right away my hypothesis was beginning to bear fruit.

I read the book, and as of writing this I'm about halfway through summarising it.

Its argument goes as follows:
1. The book discusses [[Neuroplasticity]], setting the scene for how malleable our brains our and how what we do changes the structure of our brains on a daily basis.
2. The book discusses how the tools and technologies we invent are often as important as the content that they then carry, I.E. [[The medium is the message]]. But this is rarely noticed or considered as the inventor is busy trying to solve a problem, and the users are busy reaping its benefits; this is even more true of the internet as people are more engrossed in it than they were with any other previous technology.
3. The book discusses how tools and technologies change the way our brains work, given neuroplasticity. It discusses [[The Four Categories of Technology]]:
	1. Those that extend our physical capabilities (ploug, fighter jet)
	2. Those that extend our senses (microscope, compass)
	3. Those that let us bend nature to our will (GMO's, birth control pill)
	4. Those that enhance our intellectual capabilities (map, clock, typewriter, books, schools, computers, internet)
	The fourth group have the biggest capacity to shape our thinking as use them intimately, for self-expression.
4. Given all of the above, the internet is changing our brains every time we use it, often in undesirable ways

# Undesirable changes
The internet can change our brains in undesirable ways:

## Hyperlinks reduce our ability to focus as they distract us with the possibility of new and novel information

![[The Shallows#^678790]]

When we come across a link, we have to pause to allow our prefrontal cortex to evaluate whether or not we should click on it. This redirection of mental resources has been found to 
"impede comprehension and retention, oh"

The book also discusses how the ability to focus is not an innate ability. 
Our default state is to constantly change our focus based on changes and stimuli in our environment, as this helped us to survive in the wild. The advent of the book was a major force in giving us the ability to focus for a long period of time, while ignoring outside distractions.
Now, **we are not growing this ability as much as reading books is being replaced by using the internet, and we are alo weakening this ability by constantly hopping from one stimulus to the next on the internet**. It is truly a double-edged sword, with both edges taking a chunk out of our ability to focus.


It would appear that knowledge work is the area suffering the most from a decline in productivity as technology is introduced. 
I posit that this is because
1. The new technology often involves unrestricted access to the internet
2. This leads to a decrease in one's ability to focus, which is a crucial part of knowledge work, leading to a drop in productivity.

# Phantom Vibrations
I think [[Phantom Vibrations]] are a great example of how the internet is changing our brains; this is where people experience their phone vibrating or ringing when it isn't; even when not using a device, the internet is indirectly distracting people and breaking their focus!
