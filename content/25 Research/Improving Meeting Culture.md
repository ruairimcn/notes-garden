# Improving Meeting Culture
Time is Ltd worked with a US-based biotech company before the COVID-19 pandemic began. The company has 13,000 employees, was experiencing rapid growth, and was noticing issues with meeting culture.


## Staff unhappy with meetings
An employee engagement survey found that meeting culture was one of the 'key sources of frustration and unnecessary stress amongst employees', who were 'especially frustrated at the number of meetings and their lack of effectiveness.'

As an example, an in-house lawyer was being involved in too many meetings by sales; these meetings gave her zero value but allowed salws to have more authority in their meetings. 

The executive team was noticing lower performance from the operations department, the VP of which felt that many other teams were pulling his department into redundant meetings just to get the department's approval. Other leaders felt similar struggles, and wanted to 'establish a factual basis for decisions and find the data around meeting culture to see how they can improve the situation. '


## Doing the uncomfortable: Changing and improving
Time is Ltd began collecting data, such as
- Type of meetings
- Internal collaboration
- Proportion of recurring meetings
- Meeting length
- 1:1 frequency (see other Time is Ltd whitepaper [[Correlation between productivity and 1 to 1 meetings]])
- Meeting size
- External collaboration
- Presence of managers in meetings
- Back-to-back meetings
- Meetings outside business hours 


They then provide a visualisation of this data to managers and department directors:

## Findings

Analysing the data showed **a culture of presenteeism** resulting in too many meetings and too little time for core work. 

Not mentioned here but relevant is the [[True Meeting Cost Formula]].

- Some employees spent up to 75% of their time in meetings (the % of employees would be good to know)
- Average meeting was 74 minutes and 9 attendees.
	- [[True Meeting Cost Formula]] puts this at meetings using an average of 666 minutes/11 hours of company time
- Many meetings were inefficient as they had no agenda and no action items


According to Time is Ltd, to create a healthy culture, meetings should
- not take up more than 30% of an employees overall time
- Have less than 8 participants
- Be under 60 minutes


## Increasing 1 to 1 meetings
Some VP's and managers discovered many employees were unsure what they were doing, and to combat this they were attending unproductive meetings that made them feel important.

They remedied this by increasing the number of 1:1 meetings (see other Time is Ltd whitepaper [[Correlation between productivity and 1 to 1 meetings]]).

- Employees got a better idea of what they needed to be doing so they became happier, more engaged, and less likely to attend unnecessary meetings 
- Overall number of internal meetings reduced by 11% per employee
- Size of meetings reduced 20%
- Meetings with agendas and follow-ups increased from 42% to 81%

# Results
By running a coaching program for managers to improve meeting culture, the company saved 244 years of work hours, or $11m.
Employee satisfaction increased by 23%.
