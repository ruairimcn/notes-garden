# Intro
The book is based on 15 years of research into understanding the historical dynamics of wealth and income. The author's goal was to make the book accessible to people without any specialist training.

The book makes use of much extensive historical and comparative data, more than was available than previous researchers. 

The book will examine what we really know about how wealth and income have evolved since the eighteenth century. 

Modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have made it possible to avoid the Marxist apocalpyse, but have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality - at least not as much as one would of imagined in the optimistic decades following WWII.

> When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the 19th century and seems quite likely to do again in the 21st, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic socieities are based. There are nevertheless ways democracy can regain control over capitalism and ensure that the general interest takes precedence over private interests, while preserving economic openness and avoiding protectionist and nationalist reactions.
