# Summary
The books makes a compelling argument for why it is much better to breath through our noses than our mouths, and discusses the science behind breath in general, and how we have been collectively getting poorer at it over time.

'*This book is a scientific adventure into the lost art and science of breathing.*'

>ðŸ’¡ "We've lost touch with our most basic and important biological function - **breathing.** "

## Introduction
>ðŸ’¬ 'There are as many ways to breathe as there are foods to eat, and each way we breathe will affect our bodies in different ways.' - Freediving instructor

Seven books of the Chinese [[Tao]] dating to 400 BCE focused entirely on breathing, saying it can kill us or heal us. 

Modern medicine and [[Pulmonology]] doesn't focus on how we breathe, most doctors assume all you need to do is get the right amount of air into your lungs and your body does the rest. Pulmonologists mainly work on problems and maladies of the lungs, not on how to optimize already healthy performance.

Breathing in different patterns can
- Influence our body weight and overall health
- Affect the size and function of our lungs 
- Give us some control over our nervous system and immune response to improve our health
- Help us to live longer

>ðŸ’¡ **The missing pillar in health is *breath.***
