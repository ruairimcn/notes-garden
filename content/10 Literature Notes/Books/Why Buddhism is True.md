# Summary
Author [[Robert Wright]] previously wrote a book about evolutionary psychology, [[The Moral Animal]]. In this book he combines his knowledge of evolutionary psychology with the knowledge of meditation he gained through practice and on meditation retreats.

It stays away from the metaphysical claims of Buddhism and looks at its psychological claims, which he does a great job of arguing for.
