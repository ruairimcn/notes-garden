 # Summary
Hyperfocus discusses the science behind and the benefits of two states of mind:
**Hyperfocus:** Focusing on one thing to the exclusion of others, to improve productivity and performance.
**Scatterfocus:** Easing off, not focusing, letting our mind wander in order to build new connections.

> ðŸ’¬ "Everyone awake on the planet, in this one moment, is focused on something. Attention is the backgdrop against which we live our lives wherever we go and whatever we do, even if we're just noticing the thoughts in our heads."
