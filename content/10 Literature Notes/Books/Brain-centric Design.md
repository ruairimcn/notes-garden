"Brain-centric Design: The Surprising Neuroscience Behind Learning with Deep Understanding"

"Brain-centric Design delivers deep understanding. Simply remembering pieces of factual data is not sufficient. With deep understanding, you can put the pieces together in order to do things like innovate, solve problems, and create new ideas."

We are all hard-wired to learn, but most of the time learning is made so boring and dull that the brain's natural capacities to learn (and to enjoy doing so) don't fire. BcD aims to fix this.

> ðŸ’¬ "There is a huge gap between **being an expert in a subject and knowing how to teach that subject to a novice.** That gap is traceable to a paradox in teaching that describes education as **the only institution where we never consider the organ that we are trying to change - the brain.**" *BcD is a solution.*

BcD exists to liberate teachers and learners - be they school teachers, corporate trainers, professors, or parents - by showing them a new and better way to teach. BcD works in the home, at the office, and with our children.

BcD is based on years of research in [[Neuroscience]], learning, and training.

## Part 1: Your Brain: Demystify Three Pounds of Goop

[[To teach you need to know how neurons work]]

[[Aha moments occur when a new neural pathway is created between existing circuitry and new knowledge]]




### 1.2 Insulating Your Neurons
[[Myelination]]

### 1.3 Get To Know Your Sexy Brain Bits

[[Basic structure of the brain]]

[[Brain Breaks]]

### 1.4 How your Brain Filters Information 

Before information from our senses reaches our frontal lobe, it goes through the [[Reticular Activation System]]

### 1.5 Google is like your hippocampus

Hippocampi are located in temporal lobes of both hemispheres. It is involved in learning, memory, and spatial mapping. It sends memories to other parts of the brain for long-term storage, and retrieves them when necessary (a big like Google).

**Recency** and **primacy** play a big role in memory retention and retrieval. Hence you are more likely to remember what you had for breakfast today than a week ago, unless something emotional or unusual occurred during breakfast a week ago, such as seeing your pet hamster being chased by a cat. 

### 1.6 Too much information and how to simplify it

Around 1956 George Miller proposed, via a study, that humans can hold 7 bits, or chunks, of info in short term memory, plus or minus 2. This was thought to be tru for about 40 years and the study was not replicated.

It was, in 2014, found to actually be closer to **four, plus or minus two.**

Important here is the concept of **chunking**, where a large piece of info is broken down into more easily consumable and remembered pieces. 

**Benefits of chinking:**
- A large list of items can become a few categories
- Bringing up one chink activates a larger neural pathway in the leaner's brain as *the more connections, the greater the power of cognitive processing.*
- Enables educators to convey info in a shorter amount of time 

### 1.7: Prefrontal cortex: Where we pay attention
Located at the front of the the frontal lobe, under the forehead is the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
It is where executive functions happen.

It is sometimes called the 'most human part of the brain' as it separates our cognitive abilities from other animals. 

Our executive function **allows humans to to filter out distractors and temptations that lead to impulsive behaviour.**

It is the last area of the brain to mature, and for most people isn't fully developed until about 25.  

>ðŸ’¡ The PFC **can be primed for higher-order executive function** and to do better at learning.

But most people don't know this and hence think more about rewards and punishment, rather than **strategizing about growing neural circuits and myelinating connections.**


### 1.8: Amygdala, your world's gatekeeper

There are two [[Amygdala]], one in each hemisphere, located above the [[Reticular Activation System]]and below the [[Hippocampus]].

It is usually associated with the hindbrain but is not inside it.

>ðŸ’¡ The amygdala is a routing system that decides whether to send info to the forebrain and [[Pre-frontal cortex]] for executive processing or to send it to the hindbrain. **It functions as a gatekeeper for a lot of sensory info.**

>ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡When the amygdala is in a hyperactive state, **it is about 80% more likely to send information to your hindbrain.** In a calm state it is much more likely to send info to your [[Pre-frontal cortex]] for **higher-order processing and executive functions.** Relax people's amygdalas prior to learning. 

**Stress** causes the amygdala to go hyperactive.
This could be from
- Fear
- Anxiety
- Boredom
- Loneliness
- Overexcitement
- Physical sensations such as pain, hunger, exhaustion, etc.


The amygdala is what sends us into flight, fight, or freeze mode, so it is a critical evolutionary adaption. 
When you trip, your amygdala sends the info to your hindbrain first instead of your [[Pre-frontal cortex]] as your hindbrain can react before you hit the ground; our PFC cannot! 

In modern life, survival has shifted more to the PFC than the hindbrain. However while our environment has changed over the last 1,000 years, our brain has not, and if stress occurs we will go into an 'amygdala hijack' whether we like it or not. 

Unfortunately **stressors are *everywhere* in modern life.**

[[Humans are built to deal with short periods of intense stress, not long periods of low to medium stress]]



## Part 2: Learning

### 2.1 What is Learning? 
Tells the story of a paradigm shift in a large airplane manufacuring company. A meeting of scientists and engineers was slow because neither had the vocabulary or deep understanding of the other.

The engineers were talking about 'lightning' which the scientists assumed was lightning as in thunder and lightening, when actually they meant *lightening the weight of the airplane*.

We must activate prior knowledge to learn new knowledge well, as we can fuse new info to old info to create a better understanding and build bigger neural networks. 

We see this in children where one question and its explanation is immediately followed up by one of the W questions, in a search for something that "*normalizes the new information so they can fit it into an existing schema or create new combinations with associate or assimilation. They are **looking for something to bridge understanding, anything to connect one concept to another for the purpose of an aha moment.***"

> ðŸ’¡ As educators, our goal is to ** maximize the pathways associated with the concept or content weâ€™re teaching**. That way, the learner can **retrieve the information efficiently and effectively the next time they use it.** One way to strengthen neural pathways is to **present the information in a way that engages multiple areas of the brain.**  Because the brain processes multiple means of presenting the information simultaneously, this information is encoded as an integrated network. When one node activates, the entire network activates.


[[Engaging the whole brain in education]]

### 2.2 Dopamine: The Intrinsic Shortcut to Learning
Learning requires both 
- **Understanding** the content
- **Enjoying** and feeling good about the experience

The key to enjoyment is [[Dopamine]].
Dopamine makes neural circuitry more effective; it can **help information  to travel at speeds of 100 meters per second** (especially if the axonal links are myelinated). 

>ðŸ’¡More efficient and complex neural circuitry = greater ability for cognitive processing. 

When one's brain does not receive dopamine, the person will engage in activities that make them appear to be unable to focus - may be part of why [[ADHD is often over diagnosed in young boys]].
The brain responds to the deficit in dopamine (which would provide comfort and reward) via hyperactive behaviour. 

>ðŸ’¡ Dopamine also helps learners to **enjoy the process, retain more info, and better understand the content.** It enhances feelings of contentment, happiness, personal achievement, and success.


Dopamine is involved in **intrinsic motivation** which is far better than extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation removes the need for intimidation, motivation, and fear - instead the learner's natural curiosity, learning for the sake of learning, drives them. 

**Dopamine is released before rewards, in anticipation.** Hence "*the chase really is better than the prize, and the journey really is more enjoyable than the destination.*"

So with teaching, learners will experience dopamine **during the learning event** as opposed to afterward. So it is crucial to build dopamine release into the teaching or presentation. **This can be done by creating lessons that are challenging but attainable,** with an element of anticipation relating to something exciting. This is an element of [[Flow state]]

#### Me Here Now
We can boost dopamine via **Here Me Now.**
This involves answering the learners question of "*What's in it for me, here and now.*" Answering this well with get their attention, increase dopamine, not needlessly activate their amygdala, and will send sensory data to their [[Pre-frontal cortex]]

Good salespeople will answer this well, increasing the odds of a sale. If they mess up and put the customer into an amygdala hijack, they are more likely to lose the sale. 

If the leaner can't related, they are more likely to experience boredom, which makes them more likely to experience an amygdala hijack. 

**Salience** (attentional arousal) is *the quality of being particularly noticeable or important*. It also causes the release of dopamine. 

Similarly **emotional arousal** is highly effective at releasing dopamine, something the media has known for years. Sometimes it is manipulative but skilled instructors can use it in a way that has emotional appeal. 

**Video games are a great example** of dopamine release via Me Here Now, emotional arousal, and salience. 

[[Extrinsic motivation VS intrinsic motivation#In Education]]

ðŸ’¡> "As long as the educator is **entertaining and provocative** and the new material is **relevant,** the learner will be engaged."
 
### 2.3 Neuroplasticity: Change Your Brain
None of the info presented thus far will be useful unless the educator recognizes learners brains as being adaptable, plastic, capable of learning. Many educators do not hold these views, as mainstream education slaps around labels like smart, dumb, gifted, ordinary, etc. 

[[Neuroplasticity#Education]]
[[Chronic stress can cause neurons to shrink]]

Our brains are **permanently plastic**. Young children and adults have more of it but people of all ages have the capacity. 


### 2.4 Every Thought Counts
[[Practice makes permanent, not perfect]]

Intentional practice makes the learner dramatically more efficient. **This also applies to our thoughts;** *you are what you think* to a large degree.

Involving more senses enhances learning (bingredients neural circuity) and enhances [[Myelination]].


>ðŸ’¡**Anyone** can learn to do **anything**! Capacity is **endless!** Potential is **limitless!** We all have brains with wiring that is **ever-changeable.**

It is all in the mind - literally. Every thought counts. 

**Whether you think you can, or you think you canâ€™t - youâ€™re right.** - [[Henry Ford]]



### 2.5 Pulling It All Together: Neuroscience, Growth Mindset, And You

>ðŸ’¡ Intelligence is malleable. Brainpower is grown. Learners are limited by their own beliefs, not their innate abilities. **This means educators have a lot of influence and responsibility when it comes to opening the ðŸšªdoors of learning ðŸ§ **


The job of an educator boils down to one question: ðŸŽ“"*How can I facilitate a learning space that works with these new mental models?*"

[[Growth mindset VS fixed mindset]]

[[Pygmalion effect]]

Help learners understand that their learning potential is limitless. Once they believe this, they do the work for you, and for them! 


>ðŸ’¡ "By educating people on how the brain processes new information most effectively, **we can create a healthier and more adjusted workforce; better teachers, presenters, facilitators, and sellers; and more knowledgeable parents.**
>
>We must truly understand **how stress impacts neural capacity,** we must surely adopt attitudes, methods, and practices that will not only alleviate stress but will also engage us in productive challenges that make stress more accessible and ultimately make life more palatable."



## Part 3: Behaviourism
### 3.1 You Get An "A" And You Get An "F"



### 3.2 Behaviourism is Outdated

Behaviourism delivers rewards that don't work and punishments that **build defence mechanisms that keep children at a plateau of below-average ability.** These problems carry over into work. 

Businesses often employ this faulty system too.

### 3.3 What Your Boss is Doing Wrong

### 3.4 Why Incentives Don't Work

Incentives mean *extrinsic motivation*
 and **it is not the *right* motivator for the brain.**

Rote memorization impedes learning.
