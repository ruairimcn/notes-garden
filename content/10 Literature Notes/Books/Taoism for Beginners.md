## Chap 1: Origins and Background
Early Chinese thought is the belief in a 'single cosmic universe, a Oneness with no beginning or end'. 
The universe began as an endless void called *Wu Chi*, pictured as an empty circle drawn by dots. 
From this arises **activity**, called *yang*, an empty circle, followed by **inactivity**, called *yin*, a black circle.
The interactions of activity and inactivity are called *tai chi*.

The ancient Chinese believed the universe was *chi*, an energy or vital force utilized in all facets of life, that flows like a river. All people, dead and alive, were thought to be a part of this universal energy.
Time was not thought of as linear, with a beginning, middle, and end, as it was thought to be in the West, instead being an *'overlapping series of circles, a continuum of shifting cycles.'*

*'The Chinese believed that things do exist, but that existence is time-limited within the cycles of inevitable change'*.
**Ruairi:** Similar to the [[Buddhism]] concept of [[Impermanence]].

## Chap 2: Lao-Tzu: Illuminating the Classic Way 
Historians have long tried to sort fact from fiction when it comes to the history and development of Taoism.
[[Lao-tzu]], born 604 B.C.E, is said to be the author of the short, famous book [[Tao Te Ching]]. His name means *old master.*
He is said to have met [[Confucius]] and been fifty years his elder. 

Some debate if he wrote the Tao Te Ching, others debate if he was even a real person; some of the difficulty comes from the fact that [[The ancient Chinese believed it was dishonourable to write one's autobiography]].
