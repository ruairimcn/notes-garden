# On The Shortness of Life

It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievement if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realise that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is; We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends amply if you manage it properly.

But can anyone dare to complain about another's pride when he himself never has time for himself?

You will find no one willing to share out his money; but to how many does each of us divide up his life! People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.

Call to mind when you ever had a fixed purpose; how few days have passed as you had planned; when you were ever at your own disposal; when your face wore its natural expression; when your mind wad undisturbed; what work you have achieved in such a long life; how many have plundered your life when you were unaware of your losses; how much you have lost through groundless sorrow, foolish joy, greedy desire, the seductions of society; how little of your own was left to you. You will realise that you are dying prematurely. 

So what is the reason for this? You are living as if destined to live for ever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don't notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply - though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your last. **You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.** 

So valuable did leisure seem to him that he could not enjoy it in actuality, he did so mentally in advance.

So he longed for leisure, and as his hopes and thoughts dwelt on that he found relief from his labours; this was the prayer of the man who could grant the prayers of mankind. 

Assuredly your lives, even if they last more than a thousand years, will shrink into the tiniest span: those vices will swallow up any space of time. The actual time you have - which reason can prolong though it naturally passes quickly - inevitably escapes you rapidly; for you do not grasp it or hold it back or try to delay that swiftest of all things, but you let it slip away as though it were something superfluous and replaceable.  

Living is the least important activity of the preoccupied man; yet there is nothing which is harder to learn.

But learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die. 

Believe me, it is the sign of a great man, and one who is above human error, not to allow his time to be frittered away: he has the longest possible life simply because whatever time was available he devoted entirely to himself. None of it lay fallow and neglected, none of it under another's control; for being an extremely thrifty guardian of his time he never found anything for which it was worth exchanging. So he had enough time; but those into whose lives the public have made great inroads inevitably have too little.

Nothing can be taken from this life, and you can only add to it as if giving to a man who is already full and satisfied food which he does not want but can hold. So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long.

I am always surprised to see some people demanding the time of others and meeting a most obliging response. Both sides have in view the reason for which the time is asked and neither regards the time itself - as if nothing there is being asked for and nothing given. **They are trifling with life's most precious commodity, being deceived because it is an intangible thing, not open to inspection and therefore reckoned very cheap. Nobody works out the value of time: men use it lavishly as if it costs nothing. But if death threatens these same people, you will see them praying to their doctors; if they are in fear of capital punishment, you will see them prepared to spend their all to stay alive.**

We have to be more careful in preserving what will cease at an unknown point. 

Life will follow the path it began to take, and will neither reverse nor check its course. It will cause no commotion to remind you of its swiftness, but glide on quietly. It will not lengthen itself for a king's command or a people's favour. As it started out on its first day, so it will run on, nowhere pausing ot turning aside. What will be the outcome? You have been preoccupied while life hastens on. Meanwhile death will arrive, and you will have no choice in making yourself available for that. 

Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today.

Vices have to be crushed rather than picked at.

The man who must fear his own memory is the one who has been ambitious in his greed, arrogant in his contempt, uncontrolled in his victories, treacherous in his deceptions, rapacious in his plundering, and wasteful in his squandering. 

For as soon as their preoccupations fail them, they are restless with nothing to do, and all the intervening time is wearisome: really, it is just as when a gladiatorial show has been announced, or they are looking forward to the appointed time of some other exhibition or amusement - they want to leap over the days in between. They lose the day in waiting for the night, and the night in fearing the dawn. 

# Consolation to Helvia

Different reasons roused different peoples to leave their homes; but this at least is clear, nothing has stayed where it is born. The human race is always on the move: in so large a world there is every day some change.

So fate has decreed that nothing remains the same condition forever.

There can be no place of exile within the world since nothing within the world is alien to men.

When one virtue has toughened the mind it renders it invulnerable on every side. If greed, the most overmastering plague of the human race, has relaxed its grip, ambition will not standd in your way. 

No man  is despised by another unless he is first despised by himself. An abject man is susceptible to such insult; but if a man stirs himself to face the worst of disasters and defeats the evils which overwhelm others, then he wears those very sorrows like a sacred badge. 

For we are naturally disposed to admire more than anything else the man who shows fortitude in adversity.

If a great man falls and remains great as he lies, people no more despise him than they stamp on a fallen temple, which the devout still worship as much as when it was standing.

The grief that has been conquered by reason is calmed forever. I am not therefore going to prescribe for you those remedies which I know many people have used, that you divert or cheer yourself by a long or pleasant journey abroad, or spend a lot of time carefully going through your accounts and administering your estate, or constantly be involved in some new activity. **All those things help only for a short time; they do not cure grief but hinder it.** But I would rather end it than distract it.

*[Seneca goes on to make the point that liberal studies are 'the refuge of all who are flying from fortune'. He says 'Return now to these studies and they will keep you safe. They will comfort you, they will delight you; and if they genuinely penetrate your mind, never again will grief enter there, or anxiety, or the distress caused by futile and pointless suffering. Your heart will have room for none of these, for to all other failings it has long been closed. Those studies are your most dependable protection, and they alone can snatch you from Fortune's grip. But until you arrive at this haven which philosophy holds out to you...'*

*Sounds a lot like enlightenment to me...]*

# On Tranquility of  Mind

## Serenus to Seneca (friends):

When I looked into myself, Seneca, some of my vices appeared clearly on the surface, so that I could lay my hands on them; some where more hidden away in the depths; some were not there all the time but return at intervals. These last I would say are the most troublesome; they are like prowling enemies who pounce on you when occasions offers, **and allow you neither to be at the ready as in war nor at ease as in peace.** However, the state I most find myself in (for why should I not admit the truth to you as to a doctor?) is that I am not really free of the vices which I feared and hated, though not, on the other hand, subject to them: this puts me in a condition which is not the worst, but an extremely peevish and quarrelsome one - I am neither ill nor well.

*Serenus goes on to describe how he loves frugality some of the time only; sometimes he finds himself drawn to luxurious but wasteful uses of money*

Let no one rob me of a single day who is not going to make me an adequate return for such a loss. Let my mind be fixed on itself, cultivate itself, have no external interest - nothing that seeks the approval of another; let it cherish the tranquility that has no part in public or private concerns. 

I imagine many people could achieve wisdom if they had not imagined they had already achieved it. 

## Seneca's reply:

*He says that the ailment Serenus describes is similar to "the condition of those people who have got over a long and serious illness, but are still sometimes mildly affected by onsets of fever and pain, and even when free of the last symptoms are still worried and upset"*

What you need is not those more radical remedies which we have now finished with - blocking yourself here, being angry with yourself there, threatening yourself sternly somewhere else - but the final treatment, confidence in yourself and the belief that you are on the right path and not led astray by the many tracks which cross yours of people who are hopelessly lost, though some are wandering not far from the true path. 

We are, therefore, seeking how the mind can follow a smooth and steady course, well disposed to itself, happily regarding its own condition and with no interruption to this pleasure, but remaining in a state of peace with no ups or downs: that will be tranquility. 

There are those who toss around like insomniacs, and keep changing their position until they find rest through sheer weariness. They keep altering the condition of their lives, and eventually stick to that one in which they are trapped not by weariness with further change but by old age which is too sluggish for novelty. There are those too who suffer not from moral steadfastness but from inertia, and so lack the fickleness to live as they wish, and **just live as they have begun.** In fact there are innumerable characteristics of the malady, but one effect - **dissatisfaction with oneself.** This arises from mental instability and from fearful and unfulfilled desires, when men do not dare or do not achieve all they long for, and all they grasp at is hope: t**hey are always unbalanced and fickle, an inevitable consequence of living in suspense.** They struggle to gain their prayers by every path, and they teach and force themselves to do dishonourable and difficult things, and when their efforts are unrewarded the fruitless disgrace tortures them, and they regret not the wickedness but the frustration of their desires.

Then they are gripped by repentance for their attempt and fear of trying again, and they are undermined by the restlessness of a mind that can discover no outlet, because they can neither control nor obey their desires, by the dithering of a life that cannot see its way ahead, and by the lethargy of a soul stagnating amid its abandoned hopes. All these afflictions are worse, when, through hatred of their own toilsome failure, men have retreated into idleness and private studies which are unbearable to a mind aspiring to public service, keen on activity, and restless by nature because of course it is short of inner resources. In consequence, when the pleasures have been removed which busy people derive from their actual activities, the mind cannot endure the house, the solitude, the walls, and hates to observe its own isolation. From this arises that boredom and self-dissatisfaction, that turmoil of a restless mind and gloomy and grudging endurance of our leisure, especially when we are ashamed to admit the reasons for it and out desires are trapped in narrow bounds without escape and stifle themselves. From this arises melancholy and mourning and a thousand vacillations of a wavering mind, buoyed up, by the birth of hope and sickened by the death of it. 

From this arises the state of mind of those who loathe their own leisure and complain that they have nothing to to, and the bitterest envy at the promotion of others. For unproductive idleness nurtures malice, and because they themselves could not prosper they want everyone else to be ruined. Then from this dislike of others' success and despair of their own, their minds become enraged against fortune, complain about the times, retreat into obscurity, and brood over their own sufferings until they become sick and tired of themselves. For the human mind is naturally mobile and enjoys activity. Every chance of stimulation and distraction is welcome to it - even more welcome to all those inferior characters who actually enjoy being worn out by busy activity.

**Thus man ever flees himself.** But to what end, if he does not escape himself? He pursues and dogs himself as his own most tedious companion. And so we must realise that **our difficulty is not the fault of the places but of our ourselves.**

Often a very old man has no proof of his long life than his age.

Then we must appraise the actual things we are attempting and match our strength to what we are going to undertake. For the performer must always be stronger than his task: loads that are too heavy for the bearer are bound to overwhelm him. Moreover, **certain tasks are not so much great as prolific in producing many other tasks**: we must avoid those which give birth in turn to new and manifold activities, and no approach something from which we cannot easily withdraw. You must set your hands to tasks which you can finish or at least hope to finish, and avoid those which get bigger as you proceed and do not cease where you had intended. 

We must be especially careful in choosing people, and deciding whether they are worth devoting a part of our lives to them, whether the sacrifice of our time makes a difference to them. 

You must consider whether your nature is more suited to practical activity or to quiet study and reflection, and incline in the direction your natural faculty and disposition take you. 

But nothing delights the mind so much as fond and loyal friendship. What a blessing it is to have hearts that are ready and willing to receive all your secrets in safety, with whom you are less afraid to share knowledge of something than keep it to yourself, whose conversation soothes your distress, whose advice helps you make up your mind, whose cheerfulness dissolves your sorrow, whose very appearance cheers you up! 

To be sure, we shall choose those who are as far as possible free from strong desires; for vices spread insidiously, and those nearest to hand are assailed and damaged by contact with them. It follows that, just as at the time of an epidemic disease we must take care not to sit beside people whose bodies are infected with feverish disease because we shall risk ourselves and suffer from their breathing upon us, so in choosing our friends for their characters we shall take care to find those who are the least corrupted: mixing the sound with the sick is how disease starts.

You must especially avoid those who are gloomy and always lamenting, and who grasp at every pretext for complaint. Though a man's loyalty and kindness may not be in doubt, a companion who is agitated and groaning about everything is an enemy to peace of mind. 

Let us turn to private possessions, the greatest source of human misery.

How much happier is the man who owes nothing to anybody except the one he can most easily refuse, himself! 

In any situation in life you will find delights and relaxations and pleasures if you are prepared to make light of your troubles and not let them distress you.

We are all tied to Fortune, some by a loose and golden chain, and others by a tight one of baser metal: but what does it matter? We are all held in the same captivity, and those who have bound others are themselves in bonds - unless you think perhaps that the left-hand chain is lighter. One man is bound by high office, another by wealth; good birth weights down some, and a humble origin others; some bow under the rule of other men and some under their own; some are restricted to one place by exile, others by priesthood: all life is a servitude. **So you have to get used to your circumstances, complain about them as little as possible, and grasp whatever advantage they have to offer: no condition is so bitter that a stable mind cannot find some consolation in it.** 

What I am saying applies to people who are imperfect, commonplace and unsound, not to the wise man. He does not have to walk nervously or cautiously, for he has such self-confidence that he does not hesitate to make a stand against Fortune and will never give ground to her. He has no reason to fear her, since he regards as held on sufferance not only his goods and possessions and status, but even his body, his eyes and hand, and all that makes life more dear, and his very self; **and he lives as though he were lent to himself and bound to return the loan on demand without complaint.**

What is the harm in returning to the point whence you came? He will live badly who does not know how to die well.

To quote Cicero, we hate gladiators if they are keen to save their life by any means; we favour them if they openly show contempt for it. You must realise that the same thing applies to us: for often the cause of dying is the fear of it. Dame Fortune, who makes sport with us, says 'Why should I preserve you, base and fearful creatures? You will only receive more severe wounds and stabs, as you don't know how to offer your throat. But you will both live longer and die more easily, since you receive the blade bravely, without withdrawing your neck and putting your hands in the way. **He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man. But he who knows that this was the condition laid down for him at the moment of his conception will live on those terms, and at the same time he will guarantee with a similar strength of mind that no events take him by surprise.** For by foreseeing anything that can happen as though it will happen he will soften the onslaught of of al his troubles, which present no surprises to those who are ready and waiting for them, but fall heavily on those who are careless in the expectation that all will be well. There is disease, imprisonment, disaster, fire: none of these is unexpected.

**Should it surprise me if the perils which halve always roamed around me should some day reach me?**

It is too late for the mind to equip itself to endure dangers once they are already there.

There is only a brief hour between sitting on a throne and kneeling to another. Know, then, that every condition can change, and whatever happens to anyone can happen to you.

*Ruairi - Buddhism links*

The next thing to ensure is that we do not waste our energies pointlessly or in pointless activities. Let our labour not be in vain and without result, nor the result unworthy of our labour; for usually bitterness follows if either we do not succeed or we are ashamed of succeeding. We must cut down on all this dashing around that a great many people indulge in, as they throng around houses and theatres and fora: they intrude into other people's affairs, always giving the impression of being busy. If you ask one of them as he comes out of a house, 'Where are you going? What do you have in mind?' he will reply 'I really don't know; but I'll see some people, I'll do something.' They wander around aimlessly looking for employment, and they do not what they intended but what they happen to run across. Their roaming is idle and pointless, like ants crawling over bushes, which purposelessly make their way right up to the topmost branch and and then all the way down again. Many people live a life like these creatures, and you could not unjustly call it busy idleness. You fill feel sorry for some folk you see rushing along as if to a fire; so often do they bump headlong into those in their way and send themselves and others sprawling, when all the time they have been running to cal on someone who will not return the call, or attend the funeral of somebody they don't know, etc... They then return home, worn out to no purpose and swearing they themselves don't know why they went out or where they have been - and the next day they will wander forth on the same old round. So let all your activity be directed to some object, let it have some end in view. It is not industry that makes men restless, but false impressions of things that drive them mad. 

Dawn drives him forth with nothing to do. 

But inevitably the mind can cope more easily with the distress arising from disappointed longings if you have not promised it certain success.

We should also make ourselves flexible, so that we do not pin our hopes too much on our set plans, and can move over to those things to which chance has brought us, without dreading a change in either our purpose or our condition, provided that fickleness, that fault most inimical to tranquility, does not get hold of us. 

In any case the mind must be recalled from external objects into itself, rejoice in itself, admire its own things; it must withdraw as much as possible from the affairs of others and devote its attention to itself; it must not feel losses and should take a kindly view even of misfortunes.

*Ruairi - Buddhism links*

So we should make light of al things and endure them with tolerance: it is more civilized to make fun of life than to bewail it. Bear in mind too that he deserves better of the human race as well who laughs at it than he who grieves over it; since the one allows it a fair prospect of hope, while the other stupidly laments over things that he cannot hope will be put right. And all things considered, it is the mark of a greater mind not to restrain laughter than not to restrain tears, since laughter expresses the gentlest of our feelings, and reckons that nothing is great or serious or even wretched in all the trappings of our existence. Let every man contemplate the individual occurrences which bring us joy or grief, and he will learn the truth of Bion's dictum, that all the activities of men are like their beginnings, and their life is not more high-souled or serious than their conception, and that being born from nothing they are reduced to nothing. Yet it is preferable to accept calmly public behaviour and human failings, and not to collapse into either laughter or tears. For to be tormented by other people's troubles means perpetual misery, while to take delight in them is an inhuman pleasure; just as it is an empty show of kindness to weep and assume a solemn look because somebody is burying a son. **In your own troubles too, the appropriate conduct is to indulge as much grief as nature, not custom, demands: for many people weep in order to be seen weeping, though their eyes are dry as long as there is nobody looking, since they regard it as bad form not to weep when everyone is weeping. This evil of taking our cues from others has become so deeply ingrained that even the most basic feeling, grief, degenerates into imitation.**

And what can each of us then hope for himself when he sees the best men suffering the worst fates? What follows then? Observe how each of those men bore his fate; and if they were brave, long with your spirit for a spirit like theirs; if they died with womanly cowardice, then nothing died with them. Either they are worthy of your admiration for their courage or unworthy of your longing for their cowardice. **For what is more disgraceful than if supremely great men by dying make others fearful?** Let us repeatedly praise one who deserves praise.

There is also another not inconsiderable source of anxieties, if you are too concerned to assume a pose and do not reveal yourself to anyone, like many people whose lives are false and aimed only at outward show. For it is agonising always to be watching yourself in fear of being caught when your usual mask has slipped. 

We should also withdraw a lot into ourselves; for associating with people unlike ourselves upsets a calm disposition, stirs up passions again, and aggravates any mental weakness which has not been completely cured. However, the two things must be mingled and varied, solitude and joining a crowd: the one will make us long for people and the other for ourselves, and each will be a remedy for the other; solitude will cure our distaste for a crowd, and a crowd will cure our boredom with solitude. 

*Ruairi - Introversion and extroversion*

Our minds must relax: they will rise better and keener after a rest. Just as you must not force fertile farmland, an uninterrupted productivity will soon exhaust it, so constant effort will sap our mental vigour, while a short period of rest and relaxation will restore our powers.

We must go for walks out of doors, so that the mind can be strengthened and invigorated by a clear sky and plenty of fresh air. 

But we must not do this [vices] often, in case the mind acquires a bad habit; yet at times it bust be stimulated to rejoyce without restraint and austere soberness must be banished for a while. For whether we agree with the Greek poet that 'Sometimes it is sweet to be mad,' or with Plato that 'A man sound in mind knocks in vain at the doors of poetry,' or with Aristotle that 'No great intellect has been without a touch of madness,' only a mind that is deeply stirred can utter something noble and beyond the power of others. When it has scorned everyday and commonplace thoughts and risen aloft on the wings of divine inspiration
