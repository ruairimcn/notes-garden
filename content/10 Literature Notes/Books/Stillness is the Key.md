# Summary
## Introduction
"*The struggle is great, the task divine - to gain mastery, freedom, happiness, and tranquility.*" - [[Epictetus]]

"*You may be sure that you are at peace with yourself when no noise reaches you, when no word shakes you our of yourself, whether it be flattery or a threat, or merely an empty sound buzzing around you with unmeaning sin.*" - [[Seneca]]

Holiday says this is a powerful idea 'made all the more transcendant by the remarkable fact that nearly every other philosophy of the ancient world - no matter how different or distant - came to the exact same conclusion... you would have heard equally emphatic calls for this imperturbability, unruffledness, and tranquility.

Many philosophies and religions have had many terms for this, in English we call it **stillness**:
"*To be steady while the world spins around you. To act without frenzy. To hear only what needs to be heard. To posses quietude - exterior and interior - on command.*"

Holiday writes that these philosophical schools and religions place stillness as the highest good and as the key to elite performance and a happy life; and that when pretty much all the wise words of wisdom from the ancient world agree on something, only a fool would not take heed! 

### The Modern World
The problem here is a timeless problem, though its scale, urgency, and particular form is modern - overflowing desks and inboxes, news and media bombarding us with crisis daily, social media overload, phones ring-a-ding dinging, etc. 

"*All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.*" - [[Blaise Pascal]], 1654. And that was true *before* smartphones and the internet! 

Stillness is not a new idea, it is an ancient one, and it is relevant to everyone; Holiday writes:
"*It is an attainable path to enlightenment and excellence, greatness and happiness, performance as well as presence, for **every kind of person.***"

This book gives practical advice on how to cultivate and make the most of stillness. 

We face many challenges in life and are pulled in a multitude of directions by competing priorities, goals, principles, and beliefs. Obstacles and enemies, and the often harsh realities of life, lie in our way. In light of this, stillness is the key.

Holiday writes:

"It is the key to:"
- Thinking clearly
- Seeing the whole chessboard
- Making tough decisions
- Managing our emotions
- Identifying the right goals
- Handling high pressure situations 
- Maintaining good relationships
- Building good habits
- Being productive
- Physical excellene
- Feeling fulfilled
- Capturing moments of laughter and joy
- Just about *everything!*


We naturally possess stillness but accessing it is not easy. 
(Ruairi: In this regard, it sounds similar to living from presence/awareness)

> ðŸ’¬ "To hold the mind still is an enormous discipline, one which must be faced with the greatest commitment of your life." - Garry Shandling


The book discusses how to achieve stillness in three domains, the 'trinity of mind, body soul - the head the heart, the flesh. In each domain we will seek to reduce the disturbances and perturbations that make stillness impossible.'

## Part 1: Mind 
"The mind is restless, Krishna, imperturbable, self-willed, hard to train: to master the mind seems as difficult as to master the mighty winds." - [[The Bhagavad Gita]]

Holiday writes of leadership:
[[To slow down and pause is the first obligation of a leader and decision maker]]


### Become present 
"Being present demands all of us. It's not nothing. It may be the hardest thing in the world. We are not present... and so we miss out. On life. On being our best. On seeing what's there. "


"We pay thousands of dollars to have a device in our pocket t ensure that we are never bored."

"Tolstoy observed that love can't exist off in the future. Love is only real if it's happening right now. If you think about it, *that's true for basically everything we think, feel or do.*"

> ðŸ’¡Remember, there's no greatness in the future. Or clarity. Or insight. Or happiness. Or peace. There is only this moment. **Right now can be a few minutes or a morning or a year - if you can stay in it that long.**


"The less energy we waste regretting the past or worrying about the future, the more energy we will have for what's in front of us."

Learn to see the world like an artist: while most of the world are oblivious to what is around them, an artist truly **sees.** An artist is *still and present *
