## Summary
The Mind Illuminated is my favourite meditation book, and it is the one that makes up the core of my own meditation practice. The content can be quite detailed and will require many re-readings, however one only has to get a handle on the first quarter or so of the book to kickstart their meditation practice.

The meditation practice in the book is [[Samatha Vipassana Meditation]], which translates into 'Concentration and Insight Meditation'. The general overview is that you start off by building powerful concentration and mindfulness (which is the optimal interaction between attention and awareness, the [[Samatha]] component), and then use this powerful concentration as a tool to examine how your mind works (the [[Vipassana]] component).

# Notes
One of my two favourite books on meditation, along with [[The Way of Liberation]]. This is the book that got me into meditation and first made me think that there is something worth exploring here. I was introduced to it by [[Oliver Burke]]. I purchased it on Amazon on my birthday, and I believe I first dived into it on the plane to Thailand when I went for the first time at the start of 2019. It holds a special place in my mind, heart, and spirit.

I own two physical copies and one digital copy. The only other book I own three copies of (as of 12/09/2021) is [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]].
