# Summary
A short but well-written, excellent guide to awakening and enlightenment through the investigation into, or focus on, the mantra 'Who am I?' the idea being that if one does this repeatedly, one will come to see that there is no 'I' or 'self in one's experience, I.E. the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] truth of [[Insight into No-Self]]
