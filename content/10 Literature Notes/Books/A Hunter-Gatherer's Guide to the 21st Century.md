# Questions
## What is the book about as a whole?
The book looks at the discord and disharmony that has been caused by our modern world progressing and advancing much faster than human hardware and software, resulting in institutions, markets, social systems, and behaviors that are detrimental to individuals and society. 

Each chapter looks at a different aspect of human life - children and parenting, food and medicine, culture and society - through the lens of what is going on, why it doesn't align with our biology, and how we can do a better job of correcting this. 

It posits that 'the problem is evolutionary. So is the solution.' 

## What is being said in detail, and how?
- Humans are best understood from the standpoint of evolution. It built us, hence it is the best starting point for learning about our hardware and software.
- Our world has become [[Hyper-novelty|hyper-novel]] and this is the cause of many problems.
