# Summary
The War of Art is a well-written manual on how to overcome Resistance, which I'll refer to specifically as [[Personal Resistance]].

Resistance is everything that appears in your mind that tries to distract you from doing your important work; from following your calling in life, from following your destiny, from achieving [[Self-actualisation]].

Resistance includes
- Procrastination
- Distracting yourself
- Negative self-thoughts, doubts
and much more.

The book explains Resistance, what it is, how and why it arises, and gives tools and frameworks for overcoming it, for fighting and winning your 'inner creative battles'.
