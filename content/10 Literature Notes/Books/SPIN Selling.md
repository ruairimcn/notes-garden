# Summary

# Notes
SPIN Selling is a book about sales that is backed by numerous studies into sales, specifically large sales that usually require more than one interaction with a customer, e.g. selling printers or websites.

I am halfway through the book as of 7th July 2021 and find its advice to be applicable to web design, so I recommend it to people interested in [[Getting started with Freelance WordPress Web Design]] to read it.
