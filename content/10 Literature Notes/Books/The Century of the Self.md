  # The Century of the Self

# Part 1: Happiness Machines

The documentary series dicsusses how the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] have been used, or weaponised, by those in power, to control the masses as democracy and populations have grown.

Other member's of the Freud family are involved, particularly Freud's American nephew [[Edward Bernays]] who this part of the documentary will focus on. He had a massive influence on the 20th century, maybe as much as his uncle.
He was the first person to use Freud's theories to manipulate the masses, mainly by showing corporations how to use them to make people want things they didn't need by linking mass-produced products to their desires. 
[[Linking products to desires]]

By satisfying people's inner selfish desires, they become satisfied and docile. This now dominates the modern world. 

Freud's ideas (at least some) are accepted now, but were hated and considered embarrasing in the century gone by. 

Sharing and complaining about one's feelings was not a done thing at the time, as a woman interviewed in the documentary says, people 'had to respect you' and if you shared too much 'your self-created empire would have fallen into bits'.

---

Freud developed [[Psychoanalysis]], the study of aggressive and sexual desires from our animal past, that are hidden in the unconscious. He argued that a barrier exists between our conscious and unconscious. 

Freud saw WWI as terrible proof of his findings. 
*Governments had unleashed the primitive forces in human beings, and no one seemed to know how to stop them.*


At this time, Bernays was working in the USA for an opera singer. He kept in touch with Freud and sometimes they went on holidays together in the Alps. 

America entered the war, and Bernays was employed to promote America's war aims in the press. Wartime president [[Woodrow Wilson]] announced that America was fighting not to restore old empires, but to bring democracy to Europe.

> ðŸ’¡ Bernays was asked to accompany Wilson to the peace conference in Paris. He was only 26 at the time. 
American propaganda had succeeded in making Wilson a hero of the masses. While watching this Bernays wondered if this kind of persuasion was possible in peace time.

Propaganda became a bard word during WWII due to Nazi Germany's use of it, so they changed it to [[Public Relations]], this was the first time it was used.

America had become a mass [[Industrial Society]].
Bernays wanted to find a way to manage and alter how these crowds of people thought and felt. He turned to Freud's writings to do this.

Freud sent Bernays a copy of his book introducing psychoanalysis. It fascinated Bernays, now wondering if he could profit from manipulating the unconscious. 
He learned from Freud that there is a lot more going on in human decision making, in individuals and in groups, than one might think at the time.

At the time, it was thought that people could be persuased by facts and logic alone. The persuasive power of emotions had not yet been discovered. Bernays was starting to realise this.
[[Logic VS Emotion in Decision Making]]

Beryans began to experiment on social classes. His first big project was getting women to smoke.

## Getting women to smoke
Smoking males had introduced a tabboo against women smoking, much to the annoyance of tobacco companies who were well aware that they were missing out on half of the market. One company asked Bernays to fix this.

He worked with AA Bril, one of the first psychoanalysists in America. For a large fee he told Bernays that cigarretes were symbolic of the penis, and if he could get women to see the cigarette as a challenge to male power, he might remove this taboo. 

He staged the following:
1. A large parade was held in New York every years for Easter. Thousands attend.
2. He persuased a group of rich debutantes (young women of aristocratic or upper-class family background) to hide cigarettes on their bodies, and to light them up dramatically on his signal.
3. He leaked this plan to the press, saying that the women were calling the cigarettes 'Torches of Freedom.'


And just like that - women began smoking. The event gained national and international attention. Smoking became socially acceptable for women via one single symbolic act, creating the idea that a women smoking makes her more powerful and independent. [[Emotion trumps logic]].

And thus Bernays discovered that people can be made to act irrationally if you link products to their desires! 
Better to appeal to emotions not logic. 
Emotional connect to products = more profit. This appeals to corporations.


## Keeping production lines going
The production lines of war were now production lines of mass produced goods, and corporations feared that people would eventually 'have enough' and would stop buying their goods that were rolling out of factories by the thousands or millions.  
At this point good were being marketed by appealing to logic, sold based on their usefulness. Promoted in functional terms. as neccesities. 

Corps needed to transform how Americans thought about products.

'We must shift America from a needs to a desires culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things even before the old has been entirely consumed. We must shape a new mentality in America. Man's desires must overshadow his needs.''
- Paul Maser of Lehman Brothers


The American worker became the American producer. The rich bought things they didn't need but the majority of people did not.

Bernays was at the center of this change. He brought psychological theory to the corporate world, to effectively appeal to the masses. 

Banks started funding chains of department stores. Bernay's worked on turning Americans into consumers. 
He invented product placement in movies. 
He had famous women deliver speeches on how women all dress the same, and how they can express their inner self through their clothing (19 mins 40 seconds). 'The Psychology of Dress' he coined it. 

> ðŸ’¡'The American citizen's first importance to his country is now no longer that of citizen, but that of consumer. '

 He worked with the new US president by using movie stars to improve his reputation - **politics and public relations became intermingled.**

 Meanwhile, [[Sigmund Freud]] became more and more pessimistic about humanity. 'Man is the most ferocious animal that exists.'

Bernay's published Freud's writins in the US, where they became popular. But they also started to weaken people's faith in democracy; it is based trusting people to be rational human beings, but Freud's writings were saying that there existed a wild, irrational animal beneath the consciousness of every person.

Leading political writer Walter Lipman argued that if human beings are in reality driven by unconscious, irrational forces, then democracy needed to be re-worked, by creating a new elite class that would manage what he called 'the bewildered herd' by using psychology to control the feelings of the masses. 


Lipman's arguments fascinated Bernays, who began writing books abut the techniques Lipman was looking for. 

[[The Consuming Self]] became the cornerstone of the USA, from economics and politics to society and family. This was happening in the 1920's and was a new type of demoracy that made the economy grow and also made people happy and docile. 

#UnansweredQuestion : was this a good way to go? Is it necessary to keep society going?  


## Stock market crash and Bernay's fall from power

The banks had been telling people that this was the dawn of a new era, where market crashes were a thing of the past. Borrowing went into the billions. But the banks were wrong.

The market began to dive and investors began to panic. 
29th Oct 1929, the market collapses. 
The consumer boom ended - due to recession, people stopped buying things they didn't need. Bernay's and public relations fell from public favor. 

[[The Great Depression]] had begun.

Some govevnments came to believe democracy would not work because it encouraged individualism but did not have the capacity to control a country of selfish people. This included Hitler and his party, who claimed it lead to chaos and unemployment. 

Nazi Germany's master of [[Propaganda]] Joseph Goebbels told an American journalist that he was inspired by the writings of Bernays. 


## The New Deal
From Wikipedia:
'The New Deal was a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939.'

Part of this plan involved increasing the government's control over business.
When Roosevelt was re-elected, big businesses decided it was time to fight back, and they got together to look at [[Public Relations]] (PR) once more.

There was a battle for private control of businesses; businesses wanted more control, government wanted to take control away from them.

Big businesses started using PR to try and convince the public that it was they, businesses, who were responsible for creating this new, modern America, and not politicians. 

At this stage Bernays was employed by General Motors, but they and other big businesses had begun to assemble teams of PR people.

It became a bitter fight. The government fought back, releasing films saying that businesses were manipulating the press.  They encouraged people to 'monitor' the press to see if they changed their stances and direction. 
But this was no match for Bernays and his ideas.

Bernays used the World Fair to start convicning people that Democracy and Capitalism were the perfect fit.

# Part 2: The Engineering of Consent
[YouTube Link](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fEsPOt8MG7E)
## Summary 
This part of the documentary looks at how politicians and planners in the post-WWII world came to believe Freud's view of there being deep, hidden, animal desires in the minds of all people, and that this was the reason for the terrible acts committed on people by Nazi Germany. 
To prevent this from happening again, they saught to develop control over this aspect of people's minds. 

Politicians, big businesses, and the CIA used the ideas Freud's daughter Anna and nephew Edward Bernay's to control the masses.


## Psycho-analysing veterans  
49% of soldiers sent back from [[World War Two]] were sent back due to mental problems. The army turned to [[Psychoanalysis]] to try and fix this. 
The documentary claims that this was the first time such detail had been paid to the fears and anxieties of ordinary people - the meetings between mentally unwell veterans and the psychologists were secretly recorded.

A European psychoanalyst is interviewed. He says in his time working in the US military, he learned that irrationality plays a much larger role in people than rationality, and that America is a country of sad, stressed, suffering people, contrary to the nice advertisements shown there.



## Faith in democracy declines behind closed doors 

Victory over the Axis forces was seen publicly as a victory for democracy. But behind closed doors, policy makers were worried by a mix of factors:
- The analysis of the mentally unwell soldiers
- The barbaric acts committed by seemingly ordinary German people
- Freud's idea of humans having primal, emotional, irrational urges in ther unconscious was taking grip and seen to be inherent in the two observations above. 

They were not close-minded enough to think that these forces existed in Germans and not Americans. 

> ðŸ’¡ Policy makers came to fear that the animal instincts and chaos at the base of human personality could spread throughout society and make it 'sick'. They believed this happened in Nazi Germany. 


Psychoanalysts were claiming not only to understand these deep irrational drives, but to also be able to control them and shape them, in order to turn people into the ideal 'Democratic Citizen' that is rational and calm. The belief was starting to take hold that **democracy alone was not enough - an effort has to be made to also make the ideal Democratic Citizen.**

Thousands of counselors were trained to introduce psychoanalysis to marriage counseling. 

*'You **can** control the fire of your emotions so that your personality becomes more pleasant. '

'A rational but also appropriately emotional person.'*

Policy makers wanted to help people to adapt and conform to their reality, the external world, thinking that this could break them away from their own internal neuroticism. But according to an interviewed psychoanalysis, they never questioned whether reality itself was the issue. 
He says
''They never questioned that reality itself might be a source of evil or something to which you could not adapt without compromise or suffering.' 



## Managing the unconscious mind of the consumer

The Focus Group was invented Ernest Dichter.


Consumers have needs and desires they don't fully understand, and companies must understand them to fully exploit/profit from them.

Psychoanalysis and its ideas had penetrated deep into American life by the 1950's. Psychoanalysists became rich and powerful. Many had offices overlooking Central Park in New York. 


A new elite began to emerge in business, psychology, and politics, tied together by the belief that humans are fundamentally irrational, and that for democracy and open markets to work, people needed to be controlled, to be coerced into being ideal democratic citizens. 


## Coup in Guatemala 
[[Edward Bernays]] helped the US goverment and the [[CIA]] to overthrow the new socialist government in Guatemala by manipulating public opinion, staging fake protests, and generally manipulating people via emotional propaganda. He portrayed them as Commies as this was during the [[Cold War]].
He had gone from helping companies to sell more to helping governments overthrow other governments. 

He coined this **The Engineering of Consent.**


## Psychology and the CIA
The CIA became concerned that the Soviets were experimenting with ways to change the memories and feelings of people via psychology, to produce more controllable citizens,  a term they coined **brainwashing.** Ironic that this was similar to what they had done in Guatemala. Psychologists in the CIA thought this might be possible and they should attempt this too.
This evidence is backed up by an interview with Dr John Gittnger, CIA Chief Psychologist from 1950 to 1974.
He says
> ðŸ’¬ 'The image of the human being that was being built up at that particular time was that there was a great deal of vulnerability in every human being and that that vulnerability could be manipulated to program somebody to be something that I wanted them to be, and they didn't want to be, that you could manipulate people in such a way that they could be automatons, if you will, for whatever your own purposes were.''



In the late 50's he CIA becam pumping millions of dollars into the psychology departments of universities across America.

## The Fall of Anna Freud
Anna Freud continued to carry the torch of psychoanalysis after her father died. But her fame and power declined in England as the 'poster children' of psychoanalysis were the children of one of her close friends. Anna analysed them in their youth, but in adult life their lives deteriorated; one son died of alcoholism, one daughter returned home to England from America and committed suicide in Anna's house, Sigmund's old house.



# Part 3: "There is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads; He Must Be Destroyed."

This episode looks at how psychoanalysis - which was mostly saying that people needed to conform to society in order to thrive - was de-throned by a new way of thinking, which pushed for letting people open up and be what they wanted to be, instead of conforming. 


A renegade group of psychoanalysis in the 1950's began to experiment with having people openly **express** their feelings. This was an attack on the common Freudian way of doing things, **control** their feelings. In this latter view they feared feelings and wanted people to live the *proper* life. 


## Wilheim Reich
Reich was the leader of this new group of psychoanalysists. Originally a student of Freud's, he disagreed with Freud's premise that society needed to control the masses and to pacify them, lest their unconscious animal desires run amok. 
Reich believed the opposite, that **the unconscious human mind is good and it is society that distorts it.**

**Freud:** Humans are the problem and society is the solution.
**Reich:** Society is the problem, the solution is ? 

Reich believed that the main unconscious force is libido, and that its release was a key part of human psychology. This was in direct contention with Anna Freud who thought the opposite, that it should be suppressed, and she was a virgin herself. 
Freud forced Anna out of the profession and its main association and ruined his career.

Reich moved to the US and lived a solitary life. 
He went mad though, building guns to destroy UFOs and make rain.
He was imprisoned for selling a device he claimed used orgasmic energy to cure cancer. He died in prison. 


## 1960 Student Protests
Students in America began to protest against the use of psychology to manipulate them, particularly by big corporations. 

*'The new student left set out to attack this system of social control. It was summed up in the sloga "There is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads; He Must Be Destroyed"''*

Protests got ugly with four students dying - they clashed against the force of the state police and military. The left began to crumble. Faced by this hurdle, instead of trying to change the external world, the government, they turned their focus inward. The focus became on changing oneself for the better in order to change society - to remove the ideas implanted by states and corporations, instead of stopping the planting in the first place. Political activism was not required. 

*'The personal became political.''*

To do, to produce *'the new self'*, this they turned to Reich's ideas. A group of psychotherapists had been fleshing out his ideas since his death. The founded the Esalen Institute which aimed to free people from the controls implanted by society. 

People were encouraged, in groups, to openly speak about things that society had repressed or had made [[Taboo]] to talk about.

Esalen started off small and came to be at the center of a national movement - *'The Human Potential Movement'*.
There were 200 centers within 7-8 years.

They experimented with having blacks and whites get together in groups to openly discuss their racism and differences - these did not go well - the documentary claims that by getting blacks together and triangle to get them to express their individuality, they took away their group identity (expand on this further).

So the Esalen institute tried experimenting with a new group - nuns. 
They wanted to try out their ideas in individuals who adhered to a strict set of external rules.
They worked with one of the largest seminaries in the USA, one that agreed as it wanted to appear modern. 

**The seminary began to change.**
The nuns voted to discard their uniforms and wear ordinary clothes.
Their sexuality came to the fore, with one novice nun seducing a classmate and then even seducing the older head of novice nuns.
6 months in, 300 nuns petitioned the Vatican to be released from their vows, more than half their numbers. 6 months later they closed their doors. Only a small group of radical lesbian nuns remained. 

Self-expression became the new interest in America.
Standod University, in 1978, looked into ways to read, measure, and fulfil the desires of these new, predictable self-expressing individuals.They advised companies on how to sate the *'individuised wants, needs, and desires of more highly developed human beings'.
*

[[Abraham Maslow]] and his [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs|Hierarchy of Needs]] enters the scene. Now focus was now on categorizing people based on their desires, not their class. A questionnaire was developed with hundreds of deep, personal questions. Usually with 'normal' surveys, efforts had to be made to increased return rates, e.g. sending a postcard first, then the form, then following up with a phone call, etc. This new one was sent straight out and had an amazing 86% return rate. Some responders even asked if there were other forms they could fill out - people enjoyed it **as they had never though of these questions before about what they felt inside .**

**Ruairi:** I am surprised that [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] came about in this commercial light.
It also mentions that self-actualisation was partially about 'being completely self-directed and free from society'


The new surveys were used to deduce people who were self actualizers, and to market new products to them. The surveys were also used to find self actualizers and to target them with political speeches which were used by great effect by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Tacher to get into power. This was a very interesting development as the new voters, who typically would not vote for conservatives, wear across a broad range of demographics, such as gender, occupation, and class. 

Ronald Reagan decided that government should play a smaller role in the United States, and hence had less government intervention. What rescued the failing economy, instead of government intervention, was that manufacturers could now do small runs of limited products, and they were now able to sell products that people bought in order to establish and portray their identity.

#UnansweredQuestion 
The American economy was saved by new manufacturing and marketing techniques; what happens when we run out of new techniques?


# Part 4
This part of the documentary discusses how a new idea came to prevail in modern society and politics. This is the idea that the fulfillment of everyone's individual needs is of paramount importance.

Sigmund Freud initially touched on and developed these ideas, businesses then used them to sell products to consumers, and we now see politics entering the ring even further. The problem is Dash these ideas were designed not to liberate people, but to exploit and control them. The rise of this thinking happened in both American and British society and politics. 

In Britain, the government were not as interested in pandering to the general public. As an example in the BBC, they would show less informative/educational TV shows such as dramas to "bait people in" in order to then get them watching more informative shows which the elites running the BBC knew were better for them.

Thatcher and Regen had succeeded in having business instead of government take over the responsibility of fulfilling the needs of the people in their societies, as well as making this responsibility, or this outcome, of primary importance in society.

The left, or Democrats, were not happy with this because they believed it was basher to show people what they had in common with others, and to get them to work together as a collective, instead of everyone prioritizing their own individual and selfish needs.

A political strategist for the labor party in Britain discusses how he believes there was a gap between the leading elite of the labor party and the people themselves, and that this gap was part of the reason they were failing to bring back voters from the conservative side. They needed to come to terms with the new individualism sweeping Britain and the US.

People now saw themselves as autonomous individuals who could demand things from government in return for paying taxes, as opposed to the past where they were part of various political and identity groups.

Selfishness was on the rise big time.

---
'It's not that the people are in charge, it's that the people's desires are in charge.'

Democracy was changing; instead of active citizens, it was now moved along by passive consumers.

But this didn't work for long; focus-group-centric politics was only a short-term success as people are irrational, emotional, and say contradictory things, e.g. they want better public transport but don't want to pay more tax.
