# Summary
The book makes the case that the human body and mind are not designed to live in the modern world. This is because modern life is vastly different from the environment our genes originally evolved in - the environment that produced the #hunter-gatherer (HG) lifestyle.

We are worse off - less happy, less content, more anxious, higher risk of mental and physical illnesses. This is backed up by scholarly comparisons of hunter-gatherer tribes.

The answer is a *multi-faceted approach* to tackling the environmental stressors on our body and returning to a nutritional and movement lifestyle reminiscent of our ancestors. A #paleo lifestyle.

Specifically:

- Eat right. Paleo diet.
- Get fit. Exercise daily.
- [[How to get better sleep]]. 
- Be in nature.
- Develop good relationships. Be part of great tribes.
- Don't use shampoo or soaps.
- Squat to shit.
- Minimise work stress.
#healthylifestyle


Then to be optimal human beings, we combine this with mind training.
- Train your mind to be more positive.
- Train your focus via concentration meditation.
- Enjoy the jhanic states of mind
- Train in insight meditation to reduce suffering by seeing the [[The Three Characteristics]].



# Meaning of Life - Hedonism

*What we consider life's successes are not the ends in themselves. What gives value to anything in life is the effect it has on the quality of experience of conscious creatures. Nothing else really matters. Nothing else has intrinsic value. And since we prefer pleasurable experiences to painful ones, we might as well devote ourselves to maximising the feelings we enjoy versus the feelings we don't, not just in ourselves, but in the world around us. If everyone had this goal, the world would be a pretty great place to live.*


# Happy Tribes
The author presents evidence, by studying several HG tribes, that shows HG's were
- Healthier, physically and mentally
- Happier; worked about 15-20 hours a week, spent the rest dancing, swimming, having sex, eating, socialising, etc.

They faced acutre stressors - 3 minutes of being chased by a panther, then safety.
We face chronic modern stresses; worrying about bills, our jobs, the economy, the news, etc.

*After spending time living with the Hadza tribe in Tanzania, Michael Finkel wrote: There are things I envy about the Hadza -- mostly, how free they appear to be. Free from possessions. Free of most social duties. Free from religious strictures. Free of many family responsibilities. Free from schedules, jobs, bosses, bills, traffic, taxes, laws, news, and money. Free from worry.*

**Our bodies and minds are not designed to deal with chronic stress. Almost if not all our modern ailments stem from this problem.**

There is a major discord; an adverse mismatch between the present way of life and the environment to which our genes are adapted. 

We use our intelligence to make matters worse, simply by imaginging the future and its problems, we induce stress.


## Key takeaway
Socialise more. Get involved in communities that interest you. Develop better and closer friendships and ties to extended family.

Surround yourself with positive influences, and people you enjoy being around.


# Paleo Diet
The science here is simple: it is best to eat what our ancestors (and hence what **we**) spent hundreds of thousands of years eating, as this is what our bodies have adapted to best digest and then make use of. 

A paleo diet is best for your mental and physical health.

**Eat:**
- Seafood (preferably wild)
- Beef (preferably grass-fed)
- Poultry
- Pig
- Other game meats
- Vegetables
- Root vegetables
- Fruits
- Nuts
- Seeds
- Eggs

**Avoid:**
- Processed foods
- Grains
- Refined sugar
- Processed oils


**Grey area:**
Depends on individual variation - elminate from diet at first, then slowly let them back in and see how they affect you.
- Dairy. Best if whole fat, and fermented such as cheeses and yogurts
- Rice
- Potatoes


# Exercise
**Exercise often.** 
Find an activity you enjoy, even better if it's social and competitive.


**Stand often.**
Exercise isn't enoug if you sit 10 hours a day.
Get up, stretch, and walk for 2-5 minutes after every hour of sitting. 

**Have better posture.**
Sit up straight. Do stretches and exercises that align muscles and take care of imbalences.

- Hang from a pullup bar in the morning. Corrects slumped-shoulders 
- Correct pelvis by lying on back and putting your feet on a chair, with thighs and torso at 90 degrees, and shins and thighs at 90. Hands 8 inches from body, palms facing ceiling. Tuck in chin so neck isn't arched. Do for 5 mins. Breath. Meditate. Hold for 5 minutes.


# Sleep

- Go to bed and rise at the same time.
- Get a dose of sun in the morning and get out of it at evening. 
- Take a vitamin D supplement if you're not outdoors a lot.
- Avoid stimulation before bed. No caffeine aftr the morning. 
- Make your room as darp as possible; close blinds, turn off LED lights - the smallest of light can reduce melatonin release.
- Sleep in a cool room.
- Make your room a sleep sanctuary. No TV shows, reading, email, etc, in bed. Sleep and sex only! Keep computer & TV elsewhere, so that your bedroom is a simple, uncluttered sanctuary that you enter and leave at regular times.
- Reduce stress. Don't lie in bed worrying about sleep. Wind down in the hours before bed.

*Modern life fails to honor the precious relationship with that astonishing yellow star, disrupting the natural balance in our lives by replacing sunlight with artificial bulbs, the great outdoors with the four-walled room, and the relaxing glow of the campfire before bedtime with hyper-stimulating TV, PC, cell phone and iPad screens. Our biological processes get thrown into disorder, leading to a society of fat, sickly, walking zombies, desperately clutching their cappuccinos like Golem’s ring.*


# Get out in nature
Not getting out in nature enough is bad for your immune system, can lead to problems with obesity, attention-deficits, and depression. 

- Get out into nature as much as possible. 
- Fill your home with plants 

'You are not separate form Mother Nature. You are a part of it, from the air you breathe to the minerals in your toenails.'


# Childhood Freedom
To be summarised. Discusses how HG's raised and educated children.


# No soap, no shampoo
Don't use soap or shampoo.
Shampoo takes all of the natural oil out of your hair, so your scalp overcompensates, producing too much and causing greasy hair if you don't shampoo regularly. It's a vicious cycle that can take 1-2 months of not shampooing to fix - go for it!

Same with soap, it kills natural bacteria that keep your skin clean. 


# Use toilets properly
Squatting is best. Toilets have us sitting at a bad angle where we have to push instead of simply letting gravity do the work. Over time this can cause health issues. Squatting is more natural, quicker, and healthier.

- Squat where possible
- Use something to put your feet on, like a stool


# Work, a modern invention
We are meant to feed our tribe and protect them, that's it for work. Not what we do now. The kind of stress and problems caused by our work today was unknown to HG's. 

The author doesn't offer a solution, I think the best bet is to make work calm and as stress-free as possible, via
[[The Basecamp Way]]


# Sex, love, and relationships
- Have great sex often!
- Lifelong and exclusive monogamy is not part of homo spaiens DNA. No concrete solution given by author. My solution is prenup and discuss in advance what happenes if one partner really wants to fuck someone else. 'Don't expect your SO to love and desire a single partner throughout their life.''


# Psychedelics
Experiment with them to explore your mind.


# Positivity challenge
Watch your mind like a hawk and squash any negative thoughts, then reframe them as positive.

Do this repeatedly to break your negative thought loop that modern life is so apt at creating. The level of negative thoughts seen today was unknown to HG's.

> Negative reactions to events are nothing more than bad habits. By breaking the negavitivy habit and replacing your old neuronal patterns with more positive ones, a situation that you once thought was a case of doom-andd-gloom simply doesn't have the same emotional connotation as before.


## The Challenge
One unbroken week of positivity - do not be trapped in a negative train of thought lasting more than one minute or you must restart.



# Calm Concentration 
Obsessive Compulsive Delusion Disorcer OCDD was termed by B. Alan Wallace, a highly advanced meditator who worked as the Dalai Lama's interpreter. Everyone has it!
We have a compulsive relationship with our thoughts and get caught up in our own ruminations. We are not in control; our thoughts control us.
The delision is that we believe our thoughts are an accurate portrayal of what's going on in reality, in the universe, but they are far from it.

Everyone has OCDD and 99% of us never realise that we don't have to - we can cure it via meditation. 

> 'If you were able to focus your attention at will, you could actually choose the universe you inhabit.'
>  - B. Alan Wallace

And the author says of the above...
> What he means is that in any situation there are thousands of different things you could be focusing on, from the tactile feelings of your feet on the floor, the sounds going on around youn etc. The world as it appears to us is determined by what we focus on. And most people get caught up in whatever current of thoughts and sensations they happen to be experiencing without ever realising they could be in direct control of their attention, like the commander of a ship, It is only when we have ot do something boring like homework or taxes that we become aware of our inability to concentrate. 

Stimulants and meds like adderall are just a band-aid. Improve your ability to pay atention via mental exercises - meditation! 

HG's did not have this problem as the need to pay constant attention to their surroundings kept them sharp. 

> If we want to be happy and calm, we need to return to the natural flow state of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. We can try to mimic their lifestyle as best we can, but we'll never completely get there. We need additional tools. With a consistent daily meditation practice of 30 to 60 minutes a day, changes in your baseline state of focus will be noticeable in a matter of weeks. 


# How to meditate
Skimming this
- Keep spine straight 


# Metta
Skimming as I knwo this. He recommends metta as it 
- Imcreases sense of well-being
- Greater experience of positive emotions
- Greater life satisfaction
- Makes you more helpful, compassionate, and decreases bias towards other.
- Makes you more likely to increase your number of social connections.
- Reduces stress, mental illness, and signs of aging.

These benefits improve over time. 


# Jhana
A natural state of ectasy. Discusses the various stages 1-4.
Strong concentration skills required - 1 to 2 hours practice a day for several months, followed by an intensive retreat, is a good base. But this varies! 

**Step 1 is access concentration.**
Distractions fall away, hardly registering in cconscious expeience. You are fully and exclusively with the breath. This is access concentration. When you can remain here for 10 to 15 minutes, you can go for jhana.

**The Science**
Jhanas activate the dopamine/opioid reward systems in the brain. However the amount of activation is not extreme - instead they explained that the subjective experience of such strong joy is in the signal-to-noise ration. Meditators report having their internal dialogue turned down, their mind becomes quiet. Brain areas associated with language are significantly less active. Meditators also report less awareness of the extenrla world, this also correlates with brain scans.

So
- Less aware of external stimuli
- Internal dialogue pacified
- Pleasurable feelings produced by dopamine/opioid system become sole focus of attention.

Apparently this results in a feeling more intnese than drugs or sex!

Such a release when induced by drugs results in a crash caused by depletion of the neurotransmitters that cause the feelings of happiness. But as there is a lower release from jhanic meditation than with drugs, there is no reported crash. 

There is also no tolerance buildup! 

It is advised that one reach the first Jhana before beginning insight meditation. 

*Will pick up here when I reach access concentration!* [[The Four Noble Truths]]

# Evolution and the 4 Noble Truths
The [[The Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]] are a path to less suffering, and more happiness and contentment.

**1: There is stress.**
Stress defined as any sort of mental teison, from the slighest feeling of unease to depression and panic. Any time we're not completely chill.

**2: Stress is caled by desire.**
Desire being all attractions, wants, desires, aversions, any judgement about what's going on and wishing it were different. 

The first two noble truths say *there is tension between what one wants, and what is.*

**3: Stress can be eliminated by turning off the mechanisms in the brain that create desire.**
This stress is a byproduct of evolution needing us to get food and mates, and avoid being eaten. Simply put, the complex emotions and wants of everyday life can be grouped into two activities:
1. Gravitating towards things that are good for the gene's ability to survive and replicate
2. Avoiding things that are harmful.


**4: The way to turn off this stress-causing mechanism in the brain is to use meditation techniques that will ultimately change the way we process reality.**

> If you look at your experience moment by moment, if the mind likes something, it moves towards that, to make more of it. If the mind doesn't like it, it moves away from that to make less of it. So incessantly the mind is moving towards things and moving away from things. It's reactive... it's built into how we pcoss events moment to moment. And what these meditation practices do is minimise, and ultimately eradicate that reactivity. And if you eradicate that reactivity moment to moment so that it just doesn't occur, there is no basis for suffering.

#meditation #A1Summary


# Awakening

#awakening is a cognitive change in how the brain perceives reality. This change leads to the diminishing and eventual cessation of desire.e It usually doesn't happen all at once, but occurs incrementally as the subconscious processes special insights into the true naturure of reality and how the mind works. It is realising that the following four beleifs are false. Evolution programmed these beliefs into us not because they were true, but because they were beneficial to the replication of our genes.

## #Emptiness
**The delusion:** The world we see is objective reality.
**The truth:** It's a highly filtered projection of our brains.

> Reality is merely an illusion. Albeit a very persistent one.
 > - Albert Einstein

> A wise man, recognising the world is an illusion, does not act as if itis real, so he escapes the suffering.
> - Buddha

All is made of atoms; objects are just abstractions, an illusion that changes depending on your size, brain, sense organs, etc. It's not real! 
The world we experience is a product of our evolution, and what we see is highly relevant to our own survival. 

You can step out of this illusion and hence have less stress and more contentent by breaking your attachment to these illusions. 


## #Dissatisfaction
**The delusion:** The external world can satisfy us.
**The truth:** As long as our minds interpret everything through the lens of desire, we will never be totally satisfied.

The author tells the story of a friend who fell in love with a girl, then hated most of a month-long holiday to France (which he previously had been looking forward to before meeting the girl, studying French etc) because he wanted to be with her. A distorted lens! 

> Because our brain is perpetually interpreting events moment by moment from the sense of attraction or  avoidance, we will never be at ease.

##  #Impermanance
**The delusion:** That things we desire are permanent, and have the ability to bring about permanent happiness.
**The truth:** Everything is impermanent.

> The Buddha noted that a major cause of suffering for people was their vain attempt to hold onto things that don't last, often in the face of logic and reason. When we understand that everything in this universe is impermanent, we stop clinging to things we hoped would never change. We become more comfortable with change. 


## #No-self
**The delusion:** There is a conscious self.
**The truth:** There is no conscious self.


# No-self
>Another startling conclusion from the science of consciousness is that the intuitive feeling we have that there's an executive "I" that sits in a control room of our brain, scanning the screens of the senses and pushing the buttons of the muscles, is an illusion. Consciousness turns out to consist of a maelstrom of events distributed across the brain. These events compete for attention, and as one process outshouts the others, the brain rationalises the outcome after the fact, and concocts the impression that a single self was in charge all along.
	>- Stephen Pinker


>There is simply no 'ghost in the machine'. That feeling you have that there is a specific 'me' is just another thought that pops up in the field of awareness. It is not a tning that experiences the other objects of consciousness, but just another object of consciousness itself.
