# Summary
The book sets out a systematic way of reading books that results in a better understanding than the typical way of reading.

It breaks reading down into [[The Four Levels of Reading]].

> ðŸ’¡ It's main purpose is to teach the art of reading good books when increased understanding is your goal.

For me, the main takeaways are
- Separate the act of getting the gist of the book from the act of understanding it. Scan it first, read the blurb, the tables of contents, the start and end of a few chapters. Get the gist. **Then** read it page by page.
	- This is called **[[Inspectional Reading]]** and also helps you to work out if a book is worth reading more thoroughly; not all are.
- Become a **more active reader** by asking questions of the book and the author, during [[Inspectional Reading]] and also during a more thorough [[Analytical Reading]].
- Practice reading faster by avoiding fixations and regressions (see [[Speed Reading Advice]]). Don't try to read all books as fast as possible; different books deserve to be read at different speeds depending on their complexity, work out the best and do that. 

# Content

## Intro
The book was first published in 1940 and quickly became a best seller, translated into multiple languages. 
This revised edition covers changes in the last 30 years that have taken place both in society and the subject:
- Shift of interest from fiction to non-fiction
- More people entering college
- Literate population is growing
- Teaching young people to read has become 'our paramount educational problem'

Some things have not changed. One is that to do all types of reading (these types will be colored later) we need to be able to read different types of texts at the appropriate speed.
Our aim is to read better; sometimes slower, sometimes faster. 

Another is that the teaching of reading rarely passes beyond the 'elementary level', even though there are further levels one can reach. 


## The Dimensions of Reading

### The Activity and Art of Reading
This book is for
1. Readers and those who want to become readers,
2. particularly readers of books, 
3. even more particularly, those whose main goal in reading books is to gain more understanding of an area/topic. 


We do not have to know everything about a topic in under to understand it; too many facts is often as much of an obstacle as too few. This is important to understand as we live in the [[Infomation Age]] where we are overwhelmed with content in multiple formats. 

Another important factor is that modern media often is often given to us under the guise of removing the need to think; intellectual positions are neatly packaged together and people think that all critical thinking has been done already for them - this is but a mirage! 
Modern Media gives the appearance of letting us make up our minds ourselves with minimal mental friction and exertion, saving us from having to compare and contrast conflicting data. 
Like putting a tape into a tape player, people insert packaged opinions and ideas into their heads and simply press 'play'.
 (for more on this see book [[The Shallows]])


#### Active Reading
Reading is an active, reactive skill, not a passive reading. 
How 'active' our reading is exists on a scale and the more the better.
> ðŸ’¬ " One reader is better than another in proporation as he is capable of a greater range of activity in reading and exerts more effort. **He is better if he demands more of himself and of the text before him.**"
> Learn to demand more of yourself and of the text you are reading. 


Teaching has a similarity to agriculture and medicine:
- Doctors do many things for patients but it is the patient themselves who must grow in health at the end of the day
- Farmers do many things for plants and animals but they are the ones that must grow in size and quality.
- Teachers help their students in many ways but it is ultimately the student who must do the learning. 


People often think that reading and listening are passive, especially compared with writing and listening. Reading and listening are thought of as *receiving* communication from someone who is actively *giving* it.

To be a better reader, we need to be more like a catcher catching a baseball; receiving but with effort. 

In summary, to better read we 
1. Read more actively
2. Understand the distinct acts involved in reading and aim to get better at each


#### Goals of reading: Read for Information and read for Understanding 
This is related to the [[Difference between information and knowledge]].

We don't measure our succeess in reading based on whether or not we simply recieve the information that the writer communicates; we also need to consider whether or not our **understanding increases.**

If we read a book and understand 100% of what is written in it straight away, we may have gained *information* but we won't have increased our *understanding.*

The more common scenario is that we don't understand some or all of what is in a book. This gives us three options:
1. Get outside help, from a living person or from another book; a textbook or commentary.
2. Decide that the parts we don't understand are too complex for us, or not worth the time it would take to understand it.
3. Go to work on the book with only the power of your own mind, gradually going from *understanding less to understanding more.* **This is highly skilled reading.**


The book gives this rough definition of "the art of reading":
> ðŸ’¡ "The process by which a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from the outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the various acts that constitute the art of reading."


##### Conditions for reading to understand
1. **Initial inequality in understanding.** The writer is "superior" to the reader in a given field. His book presents the insights he possesses that the reader does not.
2. **The reader must be able to overcome this this inequality to some degree.** They don't have to overcome it fully, just to some degree; to the extent that it is overcome, clarity of communication is achieved.

We can only learn from our betters.

### Learning by Instruction VS Learning by Discovery
[[To be informed is to merely know a fact, to be knowledgeable is to also know what it is all about]]

[[Learning by aided discovery and unaided discovery]]

[[Present and Absent Teachers]] - given that reading is learning from an absent teacher, **we must learn how to teach ourselves well from reading books.**

## The Levels of Reading
There are four distinct levels of reading. They are called levels as each one builds on the next.

1: [[Elementary Reading]] - Also called rudimentary, basic, or initial reading, this is the first level that one goes through, moving from noliteracy to beginner literacy. One learns the basic art of reading.

2: [[Inspectional Reading]] - Understanding the structure of a book, then skimming it to get the gist, in a limited amount of time.

3: [[Analytical Reading]] - Thorough, complete reading of a book, the best you can do with unlimited time. Asking many organised questions of the book.

4: [[Synoptical Reading]] - Also called comparative reading, this involved reading many books, then comparing them and learning about the subject/s they revolve around. It allows for creating an analysis of the subject that might not be in any of the books. 


### On Reading Speed
The authors suggest that people adjust the speed of their reading based on the material they are reading; that many people aught to be able to read faster than they do, but that some people also read too fast sometimes.

> ðŸ’¬ A good speed reading course should therefore teach you to read ad many different speeds. It should enable you to *vary your rate of reading in accordance with the nature and complexity of the material*.

The authors write that
"Many books are hardly worth even skimming; some should be read quickly; and a few should be read at a rate, usually quite slow, that allows for complete comprehension. **It is wasteful to read a book slowly that deserves only a fast reading; speed reading skills can help you solve that problem.**"

We can learn to read quicker by learning about [[Speed Reading Advice]]

> ðŸ’¡ There is no single speed at which you should read a book. 


## How to be a demanding reader

### Asking questions of a book
The essence of **Active Reading**, that brings you above the level of [[Elementary Reading]], is to ask of the book the right questions in the right order.

The authors suggest the following questions:

1. **What is the book about as a whole?** What is the main theme and how does the author develop it?
2. **What is being said in detail, and how?** What are the main messages, postulations, and arguments that make up the main theme?
3. **Is the book true, in whole or in part?** You must be able to answer the first two questions to answer this one. You are obligated to make up your own mind.
4. **What of it?** If the book has given you a new understanding, new knowledge, what is its significance? 


> ðŸ’¬ "Answering these questions is the difference between a demanding and undemanding reader.""

They apply to *anything* worth reading, from books and articles to advertisements and essays. 

Make it your aim to make this question-asking a habit. 

### Making a book your own
You could attempt to answer these questions in your mind, but it is better to do so with pen and paper. Better to record your answers while they are fresh in your mind. Marking a book and making it a part of yourself is a great way to assimilate its teachings. 

**Benefits of marking a book:**
1. Helps to keep you awake and focused.
2. Thinking lends itself to expression in words.
3. Writing down your reactions helps you to remember the content.

> ðŸ’¬ "**Reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author.** Presumably he knows more about the subject than you do; if not, you probably should not be bothering with his book. But **understanding is a two-way operation; the learner has to question himself and question the teacher.** Marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author. It is the highest recpect you can pay him."

#### Ways to make a book your own 
![[Marking a book and making it your own#Marking a book and making it your own]]


#### Three kinds of notetaking
The types of notes we take will depend on what level of reading we are doing.

[[Structural Note-taking]] - Done while doing [[Inspectional Reading]]. These notes are for working out the structure of the book, not its substance (at least not in detail).

### Building the habit
There are a lot of moving parts to the skill of expert reading, and it will take time and practice to hone this hard skill. But over time the many skills and moving parts will coalesce into a single habit.

## Analytical Reading, The Third Level
[[Analytical Reading]] will be discussed in relation to reading whole books, but can be applied to other types of reading materials too. Sometimes the rules will not apply exactly the same way to other written works, but as you gain experience with them you can adapt them to make them work. 

We will discuss it in relation to the rules that comprise it:
