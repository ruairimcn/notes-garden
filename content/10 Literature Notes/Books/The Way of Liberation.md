A book about [[Meditation]] and [[Awakening]] by [[Adyashanti]] (abbreviated as Adya)
Abbreviated as **WL**

Adya describes the book as *'A practical guide to spiritual enlightenment'*

It is short, concise, written brilliantly. A succinct, detailed guide to meditation and elightenment. 

# Preface
I really like the book's preface so I'll quote it here:
> ðŸ’¡'This book is a clue left behind, a means of remembrance, and a guide to waking up from your imagined status as a person to what you really are. The teachings contained within this book are a condensed version of my core teachings. In order for the teaching to have any effect, you must apply it with utmost dedication. Be forewarned, applying these techniques may be damping to your beliefs, disorienting to your mind, and distressing to your ego. From the perspective of waking up to reality these are good things to cultivate. From the perspective of ego they are to be avoided at all costs. The choice is entirely yours.


# Introduction
- It is impossible to know what liberation or enlightenment is or feels like, or even what the words truly mean, without realizing them first.  So the author advises against speculating about what it is, saying this is a major hindrance to its unfolding. **Instead he advises we progressively realize what is *not* absolutely true.**
- Adya says that many people incorrectly assume that a spiritual teaching will give answers to life's big questions - he has the opposite is true, that a good teaching makes you question your answers, and that this is a good thing because our assumptions - both conscious and unconscious - is what distorts our reality and causes us to *'see separation and division where there is actually only unity and completeness.'*
- Adya says that the Reality these teachings point to are in plain sight, and to walk this path we are changing the way we see reality. Hence it cannot be earned, found, or figured out. It is right here with us at all times, we just don't know it because we humans have managed to delude ourselves as to what reality truly is.
- The teachings are a call to action; something to do, not something to simply know in our minds. Engage with the teachings as opposed to spectating them.
- Take these teachings on their own, don't interpret them through the lens of any other teachings. 
- Focus on removing and letting go of any and all illusions. 
- To study The Way of Liberation is to study yourself. This doesn't mean adding more knowledge to your already-cluttered brain, but to remove your assumptions - race, name, gender, occupation, all stories. Strip yourself down to 'I am, I exist'.
- This book will help you go from* 'the dream state of ego to the awakened state beyond ego as quickly and efficiently as possible. The journey isn't what anyone anticipates, and enlightenment isn't what it is frequently sold as .' *
- Adya briefly discusses how we are at a critical point in time, meaning the perils we humans have created on earth. He eloquently writes that *'We have sailed the ship of delusion about as far as she can carry us We have run her ashore and now find ourselves shipwrecked on an increasingly desolate land. Wake up or perish.'*
