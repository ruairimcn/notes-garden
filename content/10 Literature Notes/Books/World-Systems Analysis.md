# Summary
## First reading
I attempted a [[Superficial Reading]] of the book where I (almost) didn't stop to look up things I was unfamiliar with (though I did note the meaning of words I didn't understand), instead continuing to move through the book so that I can better understand it on a second reading.

### What I gleaned
World-systems analysis (or World-systems theory) is one of many frameworks that exist for attempting to examine and understand the world we live in.

It opens by saying that part of our inability to get a good understanding of the world is that we have compartmentalized knowledge into neat boxes like physics, history, sociology, economics, etc, and that doing so means we miss out on some of the overlap in these fields, resulting in a lessening of their accuracy in understanding the past and present, and predicting the future. 

It discusses
[[Core and Peripherary Countries]]: Core countries have mostly core processes/industries that can be monopolized partially or fully, resulting in more income, peripherary countries have peripherary processes that are less profitable, [[Semi-periphery countries]] lie in the middle. Leading industries that make a lot of profit are often invented by [[Core countries]] and eventually are moved to [[Semi-periphery countries]] to take advantage of lower wages. 

- Three important turning points of our modern world-system:
	1. The long sixteenth century when our modern world-system came into existence as a [[Capitalist world-economy]]
	2. The French Revolution of 1789 in which 
		1. The idea of social and political change and upheaval became the norm, and
		2. ...
	3. The world revolution of 1968 'which presaged the long terminal phase of the modern world-system in which we find ourselves'


- The split of sciences into nomothetic/law-based sciences (hard sciences) and idiographic sciences (soft science, the humanities), and how science and knowledge in general changed and evolved
- Substituting 'world-system' as the inv of analysis, as opposed to the national state
- Capitalism and how the current world-system supports it.
- The household and its various methods of income, firms and their dependence on the state
- Universalism, racism and sexism, equality and liberty are discussed
- Sovereignty is discussed as being a reciprocal agreement between states
