# Summary
An excellent book that asks you questions about you, your past, present, and future, to help bring awareness and curioisty to your life, in order to improve it and enjoy it more. It has space for writing answers. 

The main areas it covers are
- Creativity and self-expression

- Grief, loss, and the work of healing

I am working through the questions with my wife [[Nanatchanok McNicholas]] and **I think it is a great book for any couple to explore together.**
