*10th Aug 2019 - Started moving notes on this book out of Dynalist*

# Intro

This book explains the basic principles of [[Buddhism]] in a few minutes. It focuses on the essence of Buddhism, as expressed in the Four Noble Truths and the Eight-fold Path. It is what the Buddha first talked about after he became enlightened - this is what makes it the essence.

Strictly speaking, Buddhism is not a religion. It does not extol belief in an external god.



# The Essence of Buddhism

Saint-Philosopher Atisha di Pankara was a Bengali scolar of noble birth who settled in Tibet in the 11th Century. He reintroduced Buddhism to Tibet after it had gone into serious decline under King Langdharma. He is credited with establishing Tibet as a centre of profound Buddhist learning. The list below is the distillation of his great insight into the essence of Buddhism:

- The greatest achievement is selflessness.
- The greatest worth is self-mastery.
- The greatest quality is seeking to serve others.
- The greatest precept is continual awareness.
- The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything.
- The greatest action is not confirming with the worlds ways.
- The greatest magic is transmuting the passions.
- The greatest generosity is non-attachment.
    - *Generosity to me? To others? - Ruairi*
- The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind.
- The greatest patience is humility.
- The greatest effort is not concerned with results.
- The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.
- The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances.
    - *Achieved by honing our ability to not apply labels and categories to everything, in order to see the truth - meditation does this. - Ruairi*
  

## The Four Noble Truths

The Four Noble Truths are the essence of the Buddha's teaching. They are believed to be the basis of the first sermon that he gave after becoming enlightened. They can be said to be the distilled essence of Buddhism:


### 1: If you are alive, you will suffer.

We humans are imperfect creatures in an imperfect world. As we journey through life we are certain to suffer physical pain from illness and injury, and emotional pain from a host of psychological factors.

But not all our time is spent suffering. Sometimes we experience pleasure and enjoyment. A pleasure-seeking person heightens their suffering because their is an expectation that the suffering should not be occurring in the first place, leading to self-pity; *it's not fair! This shouldn't be happening! Why me? Poor me!*

The first Noble Truth therefore counsels people to regard suffering as unavoidable in the unenlightened state that most people live in for most of the time. When happiness comes along, enjoy it while it lasts because it will not be permanent. Don't try to hold on as if it were permanent because when it leaves, it will upset you.

The enlightened person fully accepts the reality of impermanence and the unavoidability of suffering so that when it occurs they do not increase the suffering through their resistance to it.

Acceptance should not be interpreted as enjoyment in a masochistic sense - the enlightened person can take immediate action to end suffering, but while it lasts, they accept the reality of it and simply allow it to be, knowing that it will pass.


### 2: The cause of suffering is attachment.

Being attached to any worldly thing always leads to suffering, since nothing is permanent and any attachment to impermanence is certain to cause suffering. 

All wordly entities, like the egoic self, social structures, relationships, human lives, and cultures, are bound to pass away sooner or later. People in the unenlightened state naturally form attachments to these impermanent things, thus creating the foundation for suffering.

The underlying cause of attachment is **desire,** which manifests itself in a multitude of ways - desire for higher status, wealth, sexual gratification, popularity, food - to name just a few.

The enlightened person understands the mind's tendency to form attachments to worldly things, including, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of **egoic self** (me, myself, I). They work daily to reduce this attachment, and recognise that while the objects of our desires were once life-affirming goals that increased our chances of survival in a savage world back in humanity's evolutionary past, these days, in a civilised world of plenty, these aspects of our more primitive self need to be eliminated or at least moderated if we are to progress spiritually. 


### 3: You can end suffering.

The third Noble Truth holds that you can end your suffering by eliminating the desire for sensual gratification and breaking the attachment you have to the egoic self and to any of the other conceptual structures that are the furniture of your life.

The enlightened person works towards the full extinction of all clinging and craving as a way of eventually reaching nirvana - absence of desire, or the extinguishment of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion. They know that the price they pay for this blissful state is the extinction of the egoic self. With no ego left, there are no boundaries to the mind. The enlightened person expands their awareness to embrace the entire world, feeling themselves to be one with all things. Their selflessness generates infinite compassion for all living creatures.


### 4: End suffering by following the eight-fold path.

The fourth Noble Truth holds that you can end suffering by following the eight-fold path. It is useful for anyone seeking to live a more moral life in this world of suffering. The eight aspects are interconnected so that they form an integrated whole, as such they do not need to be performed in any sequence.

The Eight-fold path aims to improve your

- **Wisdom** by practicing right view and intention
- **Ethical conduct** by practicing right speech, action and livelihood
- **Mental capabilities** by practicing right effort, mindfulness and concentration.

The practices of this path are powerful agents of transformation in a person's life if they are practiced diligently over time. The path allows you to live in a way that minimises suffering and maximises happiness. 


## The Eight-fold Path


### Right View

The cultivation of Right View is about applying the Four Noble Truths in your life, taking them from abstract ideas into a living reality. The enlightened person sees the truth of the world, recognising the flawed and temporary nature of objects and ideas. They see the cause and effect relationships that connect the events of the world.

Because all ideas and concepts are ultimately impermanent, the enlightened person does not rely on ideologies and other external explanations of the world in order to practice Right View. Instead they cultivate their intuition and use it to build a deeper understanding of the world beyond the level of appearances.


### Right Intention

Humans are volitional, able to experience choice. Yet having the capability to make choices does not mean a person will exercise it. They might take the effortless route of allowing the base desires to guide their actions which requires little conscious thought. 

Right Intention is the commitment to become a more conscious person with a self-improvement mind-set. Upon this foundation of conscious self-improvement, the enlightened person creates an inner environment in which they consciously choose, moment-by-moment, the course of action that will help them become a better person. 

There are three aspects to Right Intention:

1. **Renunciation,** where you resolve to resist the pull of various desires.
2. **Good will,** where you resolve to avoid indulging in anger. 
3. **Harmlessness,** where you resolve to do no harm and to be compassionate.


### Right Speech

Words can be powerful, they can make or break a person's life, start wars, or bring peace. They can indeed be mightier than the sword, as great orators have proven. Right Speech (including written & typed words) is therefore the principle of always expressing oneself in a way that enhances the quality of people's lives, and does no harm.

It means refraining from

- Lies and deceit
- Malicious language (including slander)
- Angry or offensive language
- Idle chit-chat (including gossip)

The enlightened person therefore tells the truth, speaks with warm gentleness when they do speak, and refrains from speaking when they have nothing important top say.


### Right Action

Right Action can be defined in open-ended terms as that which a person should **not** do. That potentially leaves all else open. In broad terms, it means refraining from

- Harming any sentient creature
- Stealing
- Sexual misconduct

Doing ho harm to others covers a very broad range of behaviours. The worst a person can do is to take the life of sentient creatures, hence many Buddhists are vegetarians. Not stealing includes all forms of robbery, theft, deceit, and fraud, essentially taking what you have not earned the right to have.

The enlightened person is therefore a kind compassionate person in their dealings with the world. They respect other's property and do not engage in sexual behaviours that harm others at either a physical or emotional level.


### Right Effort

This is being prepared to put in as much effort as is needed to live the Four Noble Truths and Eight-fold path. Some people will ration how much effort they will exert, which excludes them from many worthy endeavours that do not appear to have a high enough return on their effort. It's an attitude of *I don't care how much effort it takes, I'm going to do it!*. As such it underpins Right Intention.

The mental energy that is consumed by Right Effort is directed into self-discipline, truthfulness, and compassion. The same energy might otherwise be channeled through a person's base nature to produce desire, aggression and violence. Right Effort ensures that this mental energy is expressed in wholesome ways.

The enlightened person therefore practices right effort by 

- Preventing unwholesome states of minds from arising in them
- Releasing unwholesome states that have already arisen
- Arousing wholesome states that have not already arisen
- Preserving wholesome states that have already arisen


### Right Mindfulness

Right Mindfulness is a state of heightened consciousness in which a person has cultivated the mental ability to see the world around them clearly, without delusion. Seeing the world clearly requires a person to allow sense perceptions to be received but not thought about too much. 

For many, receiving a sense perception triggers a train of thought in which the sense object is categorised and thought about until a conclusion is reached. This conclusion is the product of complex processing and ends up bearing little resemblance to external reality that produced it, having been filtered through one's preconceived ideas. It is a process that occurs automatically and unconsciously for most of the time.

Right Mindfulness is therefore about becoming
- Conscious of your mind's tendency to interpret and distort meaning from our experience of the world
- Able to limit this tendency by simply allowing the world to be what it is without judging or wishing it were otherwise.

If you do this, you will experience the world more fully and gain greater intuitive insight into the nature of reality.

The enlightened person has learned to observe their mind and control how it goes. The have cultivated **consciousness about consciousness.** It is doubtful whether any other creature on this planet is capable of this meta-awareness, since it appears to be a function of the recently evolved portions of the human brain that other animals do not have. Exercising these higher brain functions does not happen automatically in most people, it must be cultivated through right mindfulness.

The enlightened person therefore cultivates Right Mindfulness through contemplating the **Four Foundations:**

1. The body
2. One's feelings (repulsion, neutrality, attraction)
3. One's state of mind
4. Observed phenomena


### Right Concentration.

This is about developing the capability to focus all of one's attention on a single object and maintain that focus over an extended period of time. All aspects of the mind are unified and working towards this one activity. Conflicting and distracting mental processes have been eliminated or sublimated into the unified effort. The object of this concentration is on some aspect of the Noble Truths and the Eight-fold path. These are considered wholesome objects for right concentration.

The enlightened person cultivates Right Concentration through **regular meditation practice.**


### Right Livelihood

This is all about earning one's living in ways that do no harm to others. Avoid ways of making money that exploit other people's weaknesses. 

Right livelihood means one should refrain from any employment that is contrary to the principles of Right Action and Right Speech, including but not limited to

- Trading in weapons
- Trading in living beings including slavery, prostitution, and raising animals for slaughter
- Butchery and meat processing
- Trading in drugs and poisons, including alcohol and recreational drugs
