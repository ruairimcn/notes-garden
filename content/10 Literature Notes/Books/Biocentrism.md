# Notes
I briefly read about Biocentrism and watched a few YouTube videos on it when I was younger, I'd guess 18/19, and worried about death. Years later I saw the book in the meditation hall library on my [[May 2021 Pa Pae Meditation Retreat]], and ordered it, along with several other meditation books, from bookdepository.com when I returned home.
