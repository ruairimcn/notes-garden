# Introduction

Learning to craft better content can involve nothing more than developing some necessary muscles. Right now you might not consider yourself much of a writer or a content creator, but you can become one. 

In our world, many hold the notion that the ability to write, or write well, is a gift or talent. 

The truth is this: writing well is part habit, part knowledge of some fundamental rules, and part giving a damn. 

> Writing is less about beckoning the muse than hanging in until the typing becomes writing.

Writing matters more now than ever. In an online world, our online words are our emissaries; they tell the world who we are. Our writing can make us look smart or stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem boring, disorganised or flat-out boring. 

That means you've got to choose your words well, and write with economy, style, and honest empathy for your reader. You need to learn how to tell a true story really, really well - be it words on a presentation, in a book, or on a social media post.


## What is content?

It's very broad - content is essentially anything your customer or prospect touches or interacts with - including your online properties and web pages and the experiences they offer, and also everything on social channels. 

Content is the entire user experience. And very often the core of the user experience is writing. Sometimes it's *literally* the experience, in the case of a blog post, book, white paper, or Twitter post. And sometimes it's the basis of a visual experience, like a video or infograph. 

Yet in this content-driven environment, businesses often neglect or overlook words - much to their own detriment.

**Think of it this way: if a visitor came to your website without its branding in place, would he/she recognise it as yours?**

So the question becomes:

Are you telling your story from your unique perspective, with a voice and style that's clearly all you?

For businesses, good writing isn't merely a tool. It's the power tool they should be wielding expertly.

Good writing is:

- **Often the foundation of good content** that gets noticed, no matter what form that content ultimately takes.
- **A mirror of good, clear, thinking** that's an antidote to the complexity that sometimes characterises our business world. Amazon's Jeff Bezos reportedly relies on writing to hold effective meetings, requiring senior execs to read six-page memos prior to in-person meetings. 
Bezos has said 'When you have to write your ideas out in complete sentences and paragraphs, it forces a deeper clarify of thinking. 
Janet Choi adds 'Writing with a narrative structure rather than relying on messaging by numbers or bullet points also pushes people to think through problems within a fuller context.
- **The key to a customer-centric, intuitive, empathetic point of view.** 'Good writing is a matter of developing the skills of intuitive psychology that are so important in every other aspect of social life: getting inside the heads of other people so that you can respect their needs and their wants.' - *Stephen Pinker.*

Words matter. Your words (what you say) and your style (how you say it) are your most cherished (and yet undervalued) assets.



## Why We Need to Wage a War on Content Mediocrity (Or, Why This Book?)

Why? Three reasons:

1. **We have become a planet of publishers.** An overwhelming number of businesses - 93% of B2B ones and 90% of B2C ones - say they are using content in their marketing mix, according to a 2014 study.

Best-in-class marketers have set up the necessary structures and processes to consistently produce content. They've linked those efforts to strategic goals, and are upping their content budgets.

Still, half of those markets studied still struggle with how to create the kind of content that engages. Ours is a world were tech and social media have given us access and power: every one of us has the awesome opportunity to to own or own online publishing platforms. I don't use the phrase *awesome opportunity lightly.* The opportunity to change how we communicate with the people we are trying to reach, and what we communicate is tremendous - yet we aren't taking full advantage of it.

**Said another way: we are a planet of publishers, but many of us are littering the landscape with content crap, squandering the amazing opportunity we have to communicate directly with those we are trying to reach.** 

We've embraced the idea of being publishers; the challenge that remains **is the doing - the writing and publishing itself.**

2. **Brevity and clarity matter more than ever.** Your awesome opportunity is also your competitor's opportunity, your colleague's, friend's, rival's, and the guy in the cube beside you who's neck-and-neck with you for that promotion. 
There's a lot of competition clamouring to be heard. That's why it's important to write clearly and succinctly; to communicate your ideas and thoughts in a way that doesn't meander maddeningly; to respect the reader; to ensure any content we produce doesn't come off as indulgent. 
As  someone who's been editing marketers for almost 20 years, I assure you an awful lot of content meandering goes on in articles, posts, PR pitches, and emails.
	
1. **What matters now isn't storytelling; what matters is telling a true story well.** Marketing pundits increasingly talk about the importance of story and storytelling. 
But those words all feel vague and amorphous. What's quality, exactly? 
*Quality, relevant content is less about storytelling; it's about telling a true story well. In our world, quality content means content that is packed with clear utility and brimming with inspiration, and it has relentless empathy for the audience.*
    - **Utility** means you clearly help your customers do something that matters to them - help them shoulder their burdens, ease their pain, help them make decisions, etc.
    - **Inspiration** means your content is inspired by data, or creatively inspired, or both. It's fresh, different, well-written, well-produced, nicely designed - and it feels like it could only come from you.
    - **Empathy** means you relentlessly focus on your customer. You view the entire world through his or her eyes.

   
  Here's a formula for quality content:

    $$Utility X Inspiration X Empathy = Quality Content$$

One of the best, quality bits of content I ever encountered was a neatly designed guide to dishwasher repair I downloaded from the appliance website, because it delivered exactly what I needed with clear utility, inspiration, and empathy. 


## So Why This Book Though?

Although many excellent books on writing already exist, I've found that a lot of writing advice is more aphorism than true advice. 

Much of what passes for writing advice gets too deep in the weeds of writing construction - great if you're looking to up your SAT score, not so good for guidance on making a great customer mailing or the week.

I wrote this book because I couldn't find what I wanted - part writing guide, part handbook on the rules of good sportsmanship in content marketing, and all-round reliable desk companion for anyone creating or writing content on behalf of brands. 

The book is separated into six sections:

1. **How to Write Better (and Hate Writing Less).** Handy scaffolding and blueprints for better thinking and writing.
2. **Grammar and Usage**
3. **Story Rules**
4. **Publishing Rules**
5. **13 Things Marketers Write** 
6. **Content Tools** 

There's a lot that's not in this book, it's not meant to be an exhaustive resource for the business of writing. Rather it's meant to be your practical go-to guide, offering the most important and useful guideposts on the path toward better writing.

Content can be complex, but it's inherently easier to use your content as a driver of business when you start with a quality product, clear thinking, and good writing. 


# Part 1 - Writing Rules: How to Write Better (and How to Hate Writing Less)

There is no one way to write, but there are terrible ways to do it. 

The book assumes you have a working knowledge of English (grammar, spelling, usage, punctuation). 

The difference between being good at math and bad at math is hard work. It's trying, trying hard, trying harder than you've ever tried before. 

This section contains everything I know to be important about writing, over 25 years of writing and editing professionally, and a lifetime of writing for fun, distilled into the most important perspectives that I think can help all of us up our writing game.

The rules here are intended to be functional *tools,* not prescriptive *rules.* So these are less hard-and-fast writing rules, more a handy set of guidelines. 


## 1: Everybody Writes

The key to taking your writing muscles from puny to brawny is to write every day. Writing is a habit, not an art.

Most of us probably already *do* write every day, be it emails, SM posts, blogs, etc. Reframe it all as a legit aspect of your daily writing workout, the same way always taking the stairs becomes part of a fitness regimen over time. 

Consider this first rule **a call to arm to improve *all* of your communications, rather than just the stuff we traditionally think of as content.** Embrace the idea that words are your Web currency, a stand-in for the important things you want to convey to your customers, and the world. 

Have the crucial shift of viewing the words you use as pieces of who we (and our companies) are online. First though, we have to overcome what holds us back from being  writers - a combination of fear, lethargy, and a lack of confidence or knowledge (or both). 

I am a writer. You are a writer. *Everybody writes.*


## 2: Writing is a Habit, not an Art.

The key to being a better writer is, essentially, to be a more productive one. Or more simply, the key to being a better writer is to write!

You'd think great writers have special inspiration or contrived stimuli to boost their output:

'*I'd love to say I have handmade Japanese paper and a 200-year-old fountain pen.. and every morning, after making love, for the third time... I go running, for about five miles... If I'm feeling lazy. At the top of our house, there's an old cupola, and I Watch the sunrise up there, in the nude, and I write my poems longhand. I'm right-handed but I force myself to use my left hand, because I find it makes me more creative. And I write, in Latin, because it forces the brain to work in a new way - backwards, like Hebrew...*

***Really I just sit in front of my computer.***

*Taylor Mali*

Many great writers have/had routines and and schedules for writing. Becoming a better writer - working the muscle - takes some commitment to simply showing up, not unlike your commitment to your gym trainer. Both writing and strength training can feel awkward and a little painful at first. But the point is to keep at it, even when it's uncomfortable and you'd rather quit.

**Simply put, the key to being a better writer is to write.** 

Make a habit out of it, because 'habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life' (Gretchen Rubin, author). Habits lend the necessary scaffolding to support better writing. 

*'Write like crap if you have to. But write every day. Keep the streak alive.' Beth Dunn, user experience editor for Hubspot.*

**Set aside time each day when you're freshest.** You've been living with yourself long enough to know what time of day works for you.

**Don't write a lot. Just write often.** Spending five hours on a Saturday writing isn't *nearly* as valuable as spending 30 minutes a day every day of the week, especially when you're just getting started. The daily part is important because habits practiced once a week aren't habits at all - they're *obligations.*

If you're doing something once a week, it's probably only a matter of time before you stop doing it altogether.

There are no shortcuts to becoming a better writer. So show up at your desk and get to it. Daily.


## 3: Shed High School Rules

Many of us learned in school to write the five paragraph essay, or some method for the specific exam system we were in.

**Don't do this!** These methods are so structured and formulaic that it's boring to write and boring to read. Worse still, it implies there is just one way to write and that other approaches to writing are wrong.

**There is no one way to write.**

What you learned in school might have once been a helpful guidepost. But it's time to let go. 


## 4: Regard Publishing as a Privilege

The best companies put the needs of their audience first; they regard the ability to create content as something of a privilege.

This is a necessary mindset for creating great content - you must value your relationship with your audience and put their needs first.

I don't say that lightly; **every bit of content you create should be to please the customer or prospect - *not* your boss or client.** 

We all have easy access to a publishing platform and a potential audience. We all have great power to influence, entertain and educate, but also to annoy, irritate, and fritter away the opportunity entirely. 

So the challenge for companies is to respect their audiences and deliver what the audience needs in a way that's useful, enjoyable, and inspired. And you must do so with **clarity, brevity, and utility.** 

**Brevity** doesn't mean bare bones or stripped down. Take as long as you need to tell the story. The length of the content is dictated by the kind of content you're creating. The notion of brevity has more to do with cutting fat, bloat, and things that indulge the writer and don't respect the reader's time. **Keep it tight.** 

**Make it clear.** Don't make the reader work hard to understand you. Develop pathological empathy for the reader. And make it useful - readers will read what you write only if it something is in it for them.

**Write, rewrite, edit.** 

Start with empathy. Continue with utility. Improve with analysis. Optimise with love.


## 5: Place the Most Important Words (and Ideas) at the Beginning of Each Sentence

We tend to junk up the beginning of our sentences with modifiers and qualifiers, making the reader work hard to discern what, exactly, we are saying. 

**The first words of every sentence should make a friendly first impression to encourage the reader to keep going - much the way a favourable first impression at a party encourages conversation.**

Here's an example, the first sentence of an intro paragraph of a Centers for Disease Control Prevention guide:

"*According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), released in 2006 by the U.S Department of Education, 30 million adults struggle with basic reading tasks."*

The primary idea in that sentence is that millions of people are not fully literate; everything else in it is secondary. The primary idea should be at the beginning:

"Thirty million adults struggle with reading, according to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) report, released in 2006 by the U.S Department of Education."

Here's another e.g:
*"It is important to remember however, that even those with higher literacy skills want health information that is understandable, meaningful to them, and easy to use."*

What happens when you scrap the stuff at the beginning of the sentence *("It is important to remember however, that...")*? You eliminate distractions, and you highlight what's important without changing the meaning.

### **Phrases to avoid at the start of a sentence:**

- According to...
- There is a..
- It is (important, critical, advised, suggested...)
- In my opinion...
- The purpose of this (email, article, post) is...
- In 2014...
- I think that...

You can tack the onto the end, or insert them somewhere in the middle - if you must use them at all.


## 6: Follow a Writing GPS

Author Andres Dubus described writing as inching your way down a very dark, long tunnel: you can make out the next few feet in front of you, but you're not quite certain where you'll end up or when you'll get there. 

What helps with the uncertainty and enormity of the task is to start with some kind of process to guide the way. 

**Process can be boring and mind-numbing in many parts of life. But in writing, process is necessary because you *need* a roadmap to get you to where you need to be.**

This process is a kind of writing GPS that gets you from discombobulated thoughts to a coherent, cogent piece of writing that others can understand and appreciate.

What follows is the 12-step process for any new, longer text you might produce - blog posts, e-books, white papers, site content, and the like. Having a big-picture view of the process, or an outline of it, is useful. 

### ** 1: Goal.** 
What's your business goal? What are you trying to achieve? Anything you write should always be aligned with a larger (business or marketing) goal - even an individual blog post.
The key here is to care about what you're writing: you can try to fake it, but readers will be allergic to your insincerity. This matters because if **you** don't care about what you're writing, **no one will.**
Let's say your goal is this: *I want to drive awareness of and interest in the launch of our incredibly cool new collaborative editing software because we want to sell more of it.*

### 2: **Reframe - put your reader into it.** 
 Reframe the idea to relate it to your readers. Why does it matter to them? What's in it for them? Why should they care? What's the clear lesson or message you want them to take away? What value do you offer them? What questions might they have? What advice or help can you provide.
This reframing is like giving your audience a gift: how can you best serve them, with a mind-set of generosity and giving?
To get to the heart of this reframing, ask:
*So what?*
And answer,
*because.
Repeat as often as necessary until you've exhausted an ability to come up with an answer:*

   - I want to drive interest and awareness in the launch of our new collaborative editing software.
   - *So what?*
   - Because our new text editor makes is stupid easy in three specific ways for those of you without a geek gene to easily collaborate from remote locales, without overwriting each other's stuff or losing earlier versions.
   - *So what?*
   - Because that's a pain to deal with, and it causes a lot of frustration and suffering for collaborative, virtual teams.
   - *So what?*
   - Because pain... it hurts. And suffering is... um... bad.

   You get the idea.
   Express your reframed idea as a clear message. In this case:

   *Our new text editor makes it stupid easy in three specific ways for those of you without a geek gene to easily work together from remote locales, without overwriting each other's stuff or losing earlier versions, which makes for happier, less frustrated collaborators. And you'll get your work done faster, with less wasted effort.* 

   **Then put that at the top of the page, like a bonfire on the beachhead, to remind you where you're headed.**

### 3 : **Seek out the data and examples.** 
What credible source supports your main idea? Are there examples, data, real-world stories, relevant anecdotes, or new stories you can cite? (Specific advise on using data in Part IV)

Don't discount your own experience; at the same time, don't rely exclusively on it. Use yourself as one of your own sources if you have relevant experience. (See Rule 17)

The writer who uses herself as a source and resource has the greatest chance of connecting with the largest audience. 

### 4: **Organise.** 
What structure helps communicate your point? A list? How-to guide? Client narrative? Organise the outline or general architecture that suits that type of story best.  (See Rule 8)


### 5: **Write to one person.** 
Imagine the one person you're helping with this piece of writing. And then write directly to that person, using *you* as opposed to *people* or *they.*

Connect your reader to the issue you're writing about (why does it matter to him?), perhaps by relaying a scenario or telling a story. Put your reader (or someone just like them) into your story right up front, because you want the reader to recognise and relate to an issue. (See Rule 17)

### 6: **Produce The Ugly First Draft (TUFD).** 
Show up and throw up. Write badly. Write as if no one will ever read it (Stephen King calls this 'writing with the door closed.'). Don't worry about grammar, complete sentences, or readability. Don't fret about spelling or usage, you'll tackle that all later. For now just get that TUFD down.

This phase is often where many bloggers end the process. But you won't do that, because you have respect both for your writing and for your reader.


### 7: **Walk away.** 
Put distance between you and your writing, between your first draft and the second. Some do a day, some do an hour. At least try to get out of the building for walk or food.


### 8: **Rewrite.** 
Shape that mess into something that a reader wants to read. In your head, swap places with your reader as you do so. (See Rule 10)


### 9:**Give it a great headline or title.** 
See Rule 69 for more on this.


### 10: **Have someone edit.** 
11. Ideally someone with a tight grip on grammar, usage, style, and punctuation. (See Rule 24)


### 11: **One final look for readability.** 
Does your piece look inviting, alluring, easy to scan? With short paragraphs and bold subheads? Are your lists numbered or bulleted? For the most part, chunky blocks of text feel impenetrable and don't convey enough energy and movement. Bulky text doesn't look fun to read. (See Rule 25).


### 12: **Publish, but first answer one more reader question: *what now?*** 
Don't leave your reader just standing awkwardly in the middle of the dance floor after the music stops. What do you want them to do next?
    - Check out other resources?
    - Sign up to hear more?
    - Register for an event or a free trial?
    - Buy something?

Consider the order of the steps in this writing process merely a suggestion - you can toss them around and follow them in any order you wish. It's all at your discretion! 


## 7: The More the Think, the Easier the Ink

The more you think about what you want to say, and plan for it, the easier it is to say.

Figuring out *what* you want to say before you figure out *how* to say it seems an obvious first step. But many writers tend to shortchange that step - they charge straight at the water and wade in. Pretty soon they're out of their depth and flailing around wondering how they ended up there at all. 

*"If I'm really struggling, it's usually not about the writing - it's about the thinking: I just don't really have the story down yet.*

*If I do know the story but I" - Doug Kessler*
