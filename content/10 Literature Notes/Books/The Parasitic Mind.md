## Don't be afraid to voice well-thought-out opinions
The main takeaway for me is that I should try to be more confrontational and willing to voice my views and opinions, in situations where  I am up against/confronted by a view that I disagree with or think is incorrect and/or dangerous.

This could be as simple as politely disagreeing with a friend who believes in a literal interpretation of God's creation of earth. Saad points out that friends who have a problem with this are not friends worth having. 


## Judgement is Okay
Judgement is okay, even beneficial when done wisely and rationally. 

> ðŸ’¬ "The difference between a judgmental ideologue and a judgmental intellectual is the process by which each arrives at his position. As long as one uses well-articulated arguments in support of oneâ€™s judgments, it is perfectly acceptable to judge."

"We judge whom to include within our close circle of friends. We judge various prospective suitors prior to marrying our eventual spouse. We judge the performance of our students and employees. Life is laden with endless judgments. If I were to ask you to think about the people whom you consider to be most interesting, they would likely have one thing in common: they judge; they opine; they take positions. 
Fence-sitters who equivocate about the pros and cons of every conceivable issue without ever pronouncing a judgment are profoundly boring people. To never judge is to be an intellectual coward for it serves as an insurance policy against the possibility of being a polarizing figure. The most charismatic public intellectuals are typically those who share their judgments on a broad range of issues."
