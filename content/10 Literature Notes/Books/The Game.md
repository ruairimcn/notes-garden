# Summary

# Notes
A great guide to success in the dating and sex world.
I began reading the book when I came to Thailand for the first time and it (along with other factors) improved my dating skills, and my interpersonal skills in general too.

It's not very applicable to my life in a long-term relationship but I would recommend it to boys, maybe aged 16 and up, as it has long-term benefits, namely that increasing the pool of women one dates will increased one's odds of finding the best long-term partner possible.
