# Summary

# Notes
## Takedowns
### Learning from mistakes is overrated
Failure is not a rite of passage, it tells you what *not* to do but not what you *should* do. Success in a venture makes you more likely to succeed in the next than someone who failed.

### Planning is guessing
There are too many factors you don't control. Plans only give the illusion control. Plans let the past drive the future. You **must be able to improvise.** Do make plans, just don't obsess over them. 

### Why grow?
Size is a poor indicator of a good business. Small can be the ideal destination, not just a stepping stone. Grow slow and see what feels right. Once you're big it's hard to shrink. Applies to all assets; staff, offices, IT, etc.
More mass means more energy and makes changing direction more difficult.


### Don't celebrate workaholism
It's unnecessary and stupid. It creates more problems than it solves.


## Go
### Make a dent in the universe
You don't have to cure cancer, just have clients saying 'This makes my life better.' Feel some urgency about this - you don't have forever! 


### Scratch your own itch
The easiest way to create a great product/service is to make something you want to use. Solving someone else's problem is a shot in the dark, the light comes on when you solve your own problem. 
This also allows you to fall in love with what you are doing.


### Start making something.
Ideas are cheap and plentiful - start making something!


### No time is no excuse
The perfect time will never arrive. Make time. Prioritise.


### Draw a line in the sand
Have your own point of view, not just a product or service. Believe in something and showcase this in your work. Make a strong stand in order to attract [[Super fans]]. 
Some will hate it, some will love it; you want the latter and don't care about the former.


### Live your mission statement
Don't just write it, live it. People can tell the difference.  


### Outside Money is Plan Z
Take as little outside cash as possible, retain ownership instead of giving up control, and spending other people's money which can be addictive. 


### You need less than you think
Be frugal. Many companies started in garages, you can too! 


### Start a business, not a startup
Startups spend money, businesses make it. A business with no path to profit is a hobby. 

### Building to flip is building to flap
Have a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. 



## Progress

### Embrace constraints
They force creativity. Think of the clever weapons prisoners make.


### Build half a product, not a half-assed product
Time and resources are limited, you can't do it all - make sacrifices for the greater good. 
Directors cut great scenes to make an excellent movie. Start chopping!


### Figure out and start at the center
Don't worry about the toppings and trimmings when starting a hot dog stand - focus on the core product, which you can find by asking 'If I took this away, would what I'm selling still exist?'
Work out the details later - architects don't fret over what tiles to use in the bathroom until the floor plan is finalized. 


### Decisions are progress
Put-off decisions pile off. Don't wait for the perfect solution; decide and move on. 


### Be a curator
Putting all the world's art into a room makes a warehouse not a museum, which is defined and made great by what's *not* on its walls. 


### Throw less at the problem
Often, Gordon Ramsay's first step in improving a restaurant is slashing the menu. *Then* he polishes what's left. Throwing more at the problem is a natural reaction, try to step back, observe, and cut back if needed.


### Focus on what won't change
Focus on what matters, don't jump on trends. Substance over fashion. Build your business around things that won't change,

### Gear doesn't matter
Guitar players say 'the tone is in your fingers'. Buying expensive effect pedals and amps won't make you a good guitar player. Equipment is not a crutch. 


### Sell your byproducts 
Ford Motors turned leftover wood from car production into a thriving charcoal business. Basecamp wrote this book. Bands turn the recording process into movies. 


### Launch NOW!
Once your product does what it needs to, get it out there. Deadlines give you clarity. Build the necessities, get them out in the open for testing and feedback. Improve. **Then** add luxuries. 


## Productivity

![[Avoid Abstractions and Illusions of Agreement]]


### Reasons to quit
It's easy to focus on what you *think* needs to be done, and a lot harder to stop and question *why* it needs to be done.

Ask the following questions to see if in fact you should quit and to avoid succumbing to [[The Sunk Cost Fallacy|the sunk cost fallacy]]:
- **Why are you doing this?** What is it for? Who benefits?
- **What problem are you solving?** Are you or customers confused? Is this an *imaginary problem?*
- **Is this actually useful?** Are you making something just for the sake of it? Have you confused enthusiasm with usefulness?
- **Are you adding value?** Adding *something* is easy but different to adding *value*.
- **Will this change behaviour?** Will it have an impact on how people use your product?
- **Is there an easier way?** Sometimes we end up taking a complex, convoluted path when an easier one could suffice.
- **What could you be doing instead?** Resources are always limited, we are always faced with other [[Opportunity costs]]
- **Is it really worth it?** Determine the real value of what you are working on before committing to it.
