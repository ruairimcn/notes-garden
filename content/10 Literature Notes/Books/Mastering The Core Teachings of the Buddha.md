## Summary
The book (MCTB) by [[Daniel Ingram]] is organized around the three basic trainings that the [[Buddha]] taught:
[[Training in Morality]]
[[Training in Concentration]]
[[Training in Wisdom]]

It aims to be a utilitarian and pragmatic book, not hiding esoteric knowledge or pulling any spiritual punches when it comes to mastering the practices tha the Buddha taught.



It is heavily influenced by the late and great Burmese meditation master [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].

Meditation at the levels described in the book requires a baseline mental and material stability - have your psychological trip together first. Daniel wants readers to be informed not only of the benefits but also of the risks associated with meditative practice. Just as athletes can push their bodies too far, meditators can push their minds and nervous systems too far. 

### Who should read this book?

My personal take is that this is quite an advanced book on meditation. Indeed it has many recommendations for other books to read, maybe the most I've seen in any book. As such I see it as being a very in-depth and detailed book that one can better understand by reading some of these recommended books first. 

That being said,  Part 1 contains a lot of information that can be relevant and informative for those new to [[Meditation]] and the [[The Spiritual Path]]. 

I find that most of its value is in its instructions on [[Vipassana]] Insight meditation, also [[Training in Morality]]. 
However, this type of meditation is, in my opinion, best done once one has a solid base in [[Samatha]] Concentration meditation, also [[Training in Concentration]].

Hence my recommendation is to read Part 1 at your pleasure and leisure, but to read [[The Mind Illuminated]] first and be around Stage 3 and 4 territory to get the most ouf of this book.
