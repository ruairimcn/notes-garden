# Summary
The main argument of the book is that **most people are pretty decent**. It argues that the opposing view of human nature - people are inherently bad and society civilizes them - is not true.


# Notes

## Chap 1: A New Realism (about human nature)
[[Times of crisis bring out the best in people]] - gives the example of both the German and British military expecting the Nazi blitz bombing to destroy the moral of the British people - in fact it strengthened it. 
People continued to fall into this trap for years afterwards, especially military experts who continued to drop firepower on civilians, e.g. [[Vietnam War]]. 

[[Selfish VS Selfless Planet]] - People think we live on a planet where most people are selfish, but in fact people are more selfless than selfish. 

These two items above are enforced by [[Veneer theory]], the belief that civilization is merely a thin veneer hiding our dark, aggressive, selfish human nature. 

> ðŸ’¡Bergman believes that to tackle the great challenges of our times, we must start by challenging our views of human nature. 

Bergman tells us [[The Parable of the Two Hungry Wolves]]

Bergman was met with much disbelief from various people he told about the book.
'A German publisher flatly turned down my book proposal. Germans, she said, don't believe in humanity's innate goodness.

According to the World Values Survey, a huge poll in the 1980's in almost a hundred countries, most people answered the latter to the question
'Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be truste or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?'

I think people take the negative view/answer partially because of the [[Negativity Bias]] - they allow negative thinking, from a handful of poor interactions with other people, to colour their view of everyone else.

Bregman discusses [[The News as a Mental Health Hazard]] and believes it contributes to our negative view of humanity.

> ðŸ’¡ 'He who tells the stories of a culture really governs human behaviour', as ideas and stories are always more than just ephemeral words; they influence human behaviour and actions.


Many great thinkers, schools of philosophy, and religions have also assumed that humans are innately selfish. And many such thinkers were hailed as 'realists.'

## Warnings
Bregman gives the following warnings:

1. To stand up for human goodness is to stand up against a hydra - veneer theory is a zombie that keeps returning. For every misanthropic argument you prove wrong, two more will take its place.
2. To stand up for human goodness is to take a stand against the powres that be. A hopeful view of humanity is dangerous to the powerful. 
3. To stand up for human goodness is to weather a storm of riddicule; to be called naive, obtuse, foolish, etc. 


# Chap 2: The real Lord of the Flies
Bregman dispels the notion that boys stranded on an island would behave like the fictional story 'Lord of the Flies.'

- The author had the zeitgeist of the 1960's on his side; a new generation was questioning its parents about the atrocities of [[World War Two]].
- The book is read as more than just a novel, it has become a fictional part of [[Veneer theory]]
- There is no evidence that children would behave this way if left to their own devices.

His main evidence against the book is the story of [['Ata Island and the Stranded Boys]].

The story is a stark contrast to so-called reality shows like Big Brother and Temptation island, where humans behave badly - cheating, lying, antagonizing, etc. But behind the scenes candidates are often boozed up and deliberately played off against one another.

Another reality show, Kid Nation, put forty kids together in a ghost town in New Mexico, hoping they would wind up fighting.
'*Periodically they would find out that we were getting on too well and they'd have to induce something for us to fight over.*' one participant recalled.

## Stories matter
One could say these shows are merely entertainment, but
> ðŸ’¡ Seldom is a story only a story. Stories can also be [[The Nocebo Effect|nocebos]]. Psychologist Bryan Gibson released a study demonstrating that watching *Lord of the Flies-*type TV can make people more aggressive.

In children, the correlation between seeing violent images and aggression is stronger than  abestos:cancer or calcium-intake:bone-mass correllations.

Girls in Britain who watch more reality TV also more often say that being mean and telling lies are necessary to get ahead in life.

# Chap 3: The State of Nature

ðŸ’¬ *"Mankind are so much the same, in all times and places, that history informs us of nothing new or strange in this particular. Its chief use is only to discover the constant and universal principles of human nature."*

The author asks:
**Are we humans more inclined to be good or evil?**
It is a question philosophers have debated for hundreds of years.
