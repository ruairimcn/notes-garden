# Summary
The Grid is a business book that helps business owners/decision makers to make better decisions by realising that **a business is a system**, so making decisions about one part of it in isolation will not yield the best results; instead synthesis is needed.

The book breaks business up into nine areas, each with three sub-parts, for a total of 27 areas across a 6-part matrix.
