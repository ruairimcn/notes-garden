# How to Take Smart Notes

# Personal Comments
I have begun reading this book as of 26th May 2021, about a week after really diving into knowledge management. From reading the introduction alone I can see how this book will improve my [[Knowledge Management]] process, so I'm very excited to get started with it!

My tools for note-taking and my method (iPad, literature notebook, etc) can be read at
[[How I write notes while reading]]

## What I want out of this book
To improve my note-taking and writing, so that my [[Second brain]] (similar to the [[The Slip-box]] discussed in the book) grows overtime to be a valuable asset and source of writing material and inspiration.

# Preface
'Notes on paper, or on a computer screen, do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavor easier, they make it possible... no matter how internal processes are implemented, you need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.' - Levy 2011

The book will give us the tools and methods needed to create and utilize this external scaffolding.

> 💡'One cannot think without writing.' - Luhmann 1992


# Introduction
The author highlights the importance of writing by stating 
'Everybody writes.'
'Every intellectual endeavor starts with a note.'

He goes on to assert that despite this, despite the important role of writing in learning, studying, and research, we don't think about it often and it's not often taught ot discussed - books are usually written about writing lengthy pieces like books, because these are the tasks that cause the most stress.

He states these books are divided into two categories:
1. Formal requirements: Style, structure, quoting correctly.
2. Psycological help: How to write without breaking down and missing deadlines.

> 💡 'What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.'

The author makes the point that building a collection of smart and interconnected notes will make **any** writing endeavor easier as instead of starting off with a blank screen/sheet, we already have a treasure trove of useful notes built, with which to begin writing. He argues for improving the organisation of **all** writing, not just the end results as books, blog posts, etc.

These smart notes can be used to 
1. Make writing easier and fun. This is something I have already found to be true by using [[Obsidian]] in combination with [[Evergreen Notes]].
2. Learn in the long term and generate new ideas by connecting notes. A relevant principle is [[Connecting vs. collecting notes]]
3. 'Write every day in a way that brings your projects forward.' I have also found this to be true after a week of using Obsidian.


The author compares writing to breathing - it's vital to what we do, but we do it constantly so it becomes something automatic, in the background. And it suffers as a result. 

> ❓'The right question is: what can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years *before* we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily?'


He closes the intro by talking about research that shows willpower is a limited resource, and how it's far better to change your *environment* then to try and exert 


# Everything you need to know
What we need to know is how to write and take notes while considering the overarching workflow and structure.

A good structure 
- is trustworthy - our minds trust it to be able to store and connect information, meaning we can stop attempting to **hold everything in our heads**. Better to oursource this to a note-taking system; a good one will have a better memory than our squishy brains! [[Outsource information storage]]
- enables [[Flow state]].
- Increases our freedom to 'do the right thing at the right time'
- Isn't too rigid; insight is unexpected and can't happen (at least as much) in a rigid structure.

The author argues that the general lack of such a structure causes much procrastination - many people want to right and enjoy it under the right circumstances, but the status quo does not encourage this. 

## On Students
Good students often struggle the most in ordet to have a great finished product. 
Poor students have an easy time:
'As long as they stick within the rigid boundaries of their discipline and read only as much as they are told to (or less), no serious external systen is required and writing can be done by sticking with the usual formulas of 'how to write a scientific paper.'' In fact, poor students often *feel* more successful (until they are tested), because they don't experience much self-doubt. In psychology this is known as the [[The Dunning-Kruger Effect]].



## Good Solutions are Simple - and Unexpected
A system need not be complex, nor do you need to reorganise everything you already have.

A good system must handle complexity, as your note system will gain complexity as it gains volume. 
Some handle this by separating notes into folders/categories, but this is more work and reduces the likelihood of [[Building and finding suprising connections]].

We can deal with complexity without compromising usability or usefulness by **keeping things simple and following a few basic principles.** And smart notes are as simple as it gets - according to the author at least! Let's read on and see if he is correct. 

**Good news: the initial time and effort can be low!**
> 💡 It's not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on.


We are just combining two ideas:
1. [[The Slip-box]]
2. Smart note principles ( #Unsure )


## The Slip-box
The author tells the story of [[Niklas Luhmann]] and how he invented and improved on [[The Slip-box]]

> 💬 'The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better th keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. **It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined, or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do. Only if the work is set up in such a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation, and work aligned - which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work ([[Flow]])**

Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is *not* the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments thad avod resistance in the first place. 
See [[Willpower VS Smart Environment]]

### Why is the Slip-box not more popular?
1. Until recently, misunderstandings about [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann's]] system led to disappointing results for those attempting to use it. Mainly, people focused on the slip-box to the detriment of the overall workflow.
2. Most of the pblished info on the system was in German and usually only discussed by a small group of sociologists who specialised in Luhmann's social system theories.
3. It's so simple that people don't expect much from it. **People tend to assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.** ( #thought : is this a cognitive bias? [[The X Must Equal Y Effect]]) ^53b2f1


In a similar way, people did not understand why [[Henry Ford]] was adament that something as simple as the conveyor belt (cars moving instead of workers moving) would be revolutionary.

### The Slip-box manual
Luhmann had two slip-boxes:
1. One for bilbiography - references and brief notes from literature
2. One with his own ideas, most in response to what he read

These were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes. 
Notes were usually written with an eye on other notes in the slip-box.
**Rarely would a note stay in isolation.** When he added a note, he checked for relevant notes to make connections betweem. 

The same note could be added to different contexts.

He didn't copy ideas or quotes directly from texts, rather he made a transition from one context to another - using different words but trying to keep the originak meaning there.

He didn't organise notes by topic, but only with fixed numbers. 
e.g.
22
23
23a
24/3d7a6
24/3d7a7

Many systems start with a preconcieved order of topics, instead luhmann developed topics bottom up.

The last element of his file system is an index, referring to other notes as an entry point into a particular topic or line of thought. Similar to [[02 Maps of Content]].


# Everything You Need to Do
💭 The author invites us to imagine a situation in which a personal assistant has prepared a rough draft of our book/blog/paper for us - references, quotes, and arguments included. All you have to do is edit, revise, and off it goes! Editing is involved work that needs focus, but it's a well-defined task. Easy!

Now imagine you are the assistant doing the prep. What would help you to achieve this?
For sure it would be easuer if everything you needed was right in front of you (see where this is going?). And not just in front of you but in order, sorted, connected, with descriptive headlines. This too can be a clear and well-structured process. It doesn't have to be an overwhelming task that has to be perfect.

So we have
1. Assemble a collection of connected smart notes.
2. Use this collection to build out a rough draft, then edit and improve it.

**Step 1 is what most people have been missing, [[Ruairi McNicholas|myself]]** included.

Going through your notes, organising and collecting them or just browsing, can indeed be fun and it helps to bring a playful mindset to the task. A less narrow focus is beneficial for seeing connections and patterns - broaden the scope of your vision. 

> 💡 Thinking, reading, and understanding & coming up with ideas is the main work. Notes are just the tangible end products of this process. Note-taking *accompanies* the main work, and if done well, supports and enhances it. 

💬 *Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. *

To learn it, write it down. **To understand it, translate it into your own words.**

> 💬 'If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn, and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for out future publications. Thinking, reading, learning, understanding, and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research, ow writes. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.'

## Writing a paper step by step

### 1. Make fleeting notes.
Always have something at hand to capture ideas. Don't worry about how or what you write - just get it done! Best placed in an Inbox that you later process.

### 2. Make literature notes
When you read, make notes on the content. Pick what you don't want to forget or might use in your own thinking/writing. Keep it short, be selective, and use your own words. Be extra selective with quotes; don't copy them, make sure you understand them! 

### 3. Make permanent notes
Connect notes instead of collecting them. Make a note for each idea. Prune fleeting notes from steps 1 and 2; anything of importance to you becomes a permanent note.

### 4. Add permanent notes to slip box
Link to related notes. 
Make sure you can find these notes later by linking it to your index or to other notes.


### 5. Develop topics bottom-up
See what is there, what is missing, what questions arise, etc.
Follow your interests and take the pat that looks to have the most insight. Build upon what you have or start fro mscratch if your slip-box is empty. 

Build your interest in topics - you will read and think about it more, and colllect and connect mroe notes on this topic.

**Your interests can and will change- this is the nature of *insight.***

### 6. Decide on a topic
Your ideas will develop enough to write about a topic, based on what you *have*, not on an unfounded idea. Goodbye blank starts!
Browse your notes and their connections, bring them into a working space. Look for missing links, redundant notes, etc. 

### 7. Turn your notes into a rough draft
Translate your notes into the context of the piece you want to write. Plug holes in your argument.

### 8. Edit and proofread. 
Then you're ready to publish!

---

The steps are presented as if you write one article/paper at a time. In reality you'll work on multiple ones, and this is where the system really shines. 

Accidental encounters make up the most of what we learn - we don't go through life only learning what we planned to learn or what we're directly thought. 

By taking notes this way, the author says
>💡Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator



# Everything you need to have
[[The Slip-box]]: Focus on the essentials, don't complicate things unnecessarily.

Writing is not a complex process requiring a complex variety of tools - but it is in constant danger of becoming this, and being slowed down by an ever-growing but disconnected list of learning and note-taking techniques. Each has its benefit but these benefits are lost and can become negatives when combined thoughtlessly.

> 💡 The writing workflow **need not be complicated!**<br><br> A system where nothing works together will be a difficult and boring workflow to write inside of.


Hence [[The Slip-box]] should not be just another technique, rather it is one part of a while new workflow that the author writes
**'is stripped of everything that could distract from what is important'. That being writing, thinking, and reading.**

Our brains are not good at objective storage of info; **the slip-box replaces it in doing this task.**

> 💡💡💡 **That is pretty much it - 'to have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter.''**


## The Tool Box
We need four tools:
1. Something to write with and write on quickly - pen and paper, iPad, etc.
2. A reference management system - author recommends Zotero
3. [[The Slip-box]]
4. An editor 



# A Few Things to Keep in Mind
It should not take long to gather your tools. Pick good ones but also be aware that they are only ever as good as your ability to work well with them.

It is important to know how this system works, why it works, and how to work with it yourself - only then can you adapt it over time to your own needs. This book aims to ado this. 


# The Four Underlying Principles

## Writing is the only thing that matters.

Once a written piece becomes public, it no longer authors what the author *meant* in his writing, it only matters what is written. Once the author is taken out of the picture,
'the written piece is a public claim on truth.'
The scientific community cares not for 'what you meant', they only care about 'what you wrote'.

The qualities of a convincing argument are always the same: the is writing must be coherent and based on facts. 

The author writes:
> Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coming. If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.


Alas this does not mean neglecting other related activities, as they are all connected and should not be divided up. 
- Don't read less; this is your main source of information.
- Don't attend less lectures, they give you ideas to write on and questions to ask.

Etc etc as these things all **support the writing process**.

Focusing on writing will help you to 
- Have a clear purpose when attending lectures/discussions
- Learn to 'distinguish good-sounding arguments from actual good ones'
- Focus on the parts of texts that are relevant to you. You can't write down everything, you need to pick out what's relevant to you.
- Help you to read in a more engaged way by rephrasing ideas to help learn them. 
- Think beyond what you're reading to turn it into something new. 
- Do the above *deliberately* as you now have a clear purpose. 


### Avoid tool paralysis
This is my own interjection as it's relevant to focusing on writing: 
For some people, myself included, looking at the array of tools and software on offer, and getting deep into each of them, is a fun but often unproductive endeavor, especially when there is writing to be done.
It's easy to spend hours and hours watching YouTube videos on how to use Obsidian, reading reddit posts on [[Notion]] personal dashboards, so on and so forth.

It's good to research what's on offer, find the best tool for you, and learn the basics of it, but don't go overboard - writing is the only thing that matters! 



## Simplicity is Paramount
As mentioned earlier in the book, Luhmann's slip box and surrounding system are simple, often leading people to dismiss it due to the [[The X Must Equal Y Effect]].

In traditional note-taking systems, the question is:
'Under which topic do I store this note?'
In the new system, the question is:
> 💡 In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? 

The author gives the example of the shipping container which had massive effects on all parts of the world and society.
He writes
'[[The Slip-box]] is the shipping container of the academic workd. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised in the same format. ...everything is streamlined towards one thng only: insight that can be published.'

Our brains are not good at storing information in the long-term. By outsourcing this task to the slip-box, our brain is freed up to do more thinking as opposed ot remembering. 


### Three Types of Notes
[[The Slip-box]] can lose its value if notes are added indiscriminately, if the basic structure is not followed. 

Notes must be added and connected in a way that starts off a [[Critical mass]]. To do this, we must be aware of and put notes into one of three types/bins:

1. [[Fleeting notes]]. Reminders of info, can be written any way, and end up trashed in a few days.
2. [[Permanent notes]]. Never trashed. Contain all the needed info for a topic/idea ina permanently understandable way. Stored in the same way in the same place - [[The Slip-box]].
3. [[Project notes]]. Relevant only to one specific project. Kept in a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archives when the project is complete. 


**Keeping these three types of notes separated is crucial to building a critical mass of ideas.**

**Common mistakes**
- Taking too many permanent notes. Overcome by selectively turning [[Fleeting notes]] into [[Permanent notes]].** Not everything will be relevant to you so don't note everything.**
- Collecting [[Project notes]] only related to one project. Not good as you start over with each project, severing possible lines of thought and insight. 
- Treating all notes as [[Fleeting notes]]. Leads to chaos and the unproductive desire to start over.

These mistakes all have the core issue of your slip-box losing value and becoming cluttered as the number of notes increases. By avoiding these mistakes the opposite will happen; value builds as mass builds and [[Critical mass]] is reached sooner.



**It is this standardised format that allows notes to reach a critical mass. To use LEOG as an analogy, you can't build a mighty towering structure out of LEGO unless the bricks follow a format that allows them to connect! **


## Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch
> 💬 'The white sheet of paper - or today: the blank screen - is a fundamental misunderstanding.' - Nasshei 2015

Many books on writing advocate for 
1. Choose a narrow focus
2. Formulate an explicit question that you will research and address


But to develop a good question you need to have some understandng of the topic already, and to know it's the right topic for you, you'll ideally have already explored many topics, not just one. 

**It's not possible to just pull a good question out of thin air.** So to decide what you want to write about before you've begun writing is a misleading instruction. 

We must be guided by our interest and curiosity which is developed by reading, thinking, discussing, writing, and developing ideas. We won't be guided by a made-up plan from our brains backed up by unsound adice on writing. 

Focus on what is interesting and keep track of your insights and developments - topics, questions, and arguments will arise effortlessly from such a system. 

Given that note-taking is rarely discussed, we end up with most guides on writing advocating for beginning with [[Brainstorming]]. Indeed, if you haven't been writing notes until now, the bra might be the only place to turn to. **But the brain is not a good choice as it is neither objective/rational or reliable.** And these are important for good writing. 
Furthermore, the brain is not the origin of most ideas; they usually come from external sources.

> 💡 The advice to think about what to write about before you have written comes too early and late. Too late as you don't have written notes to refer to, and too early as you can't just postpone writing until you've decided what to write on. 


Something that comes too early and too late can't be fixed by changing the order! The finctional, linear process must be broke, and this starts with taking smart notes. 

Your workflow should become circular not linear; eventually the problem of finding a topic should become the problem of having too many topics to choose from. 

Study guides promoting this linear process is similar to financial advisors discussing how 65 year olds can save for retirement. 

By taking smart notes you can keep your focus on what interests you, and you will develop valuable and substantial material just by doing what you most feel like doing.
On a #PersonalNote I have already found this to be very true. If I lose interest in writing technical notes about DNS records, I can just switch to writing notes on where my interest has moved, e.g. meditation. 

By taking smart notes, you can relax, trusting that interesting questions, insights, and topics will emerge naturally from this process. You don't know (nor need to know) where this process will end up, but this is fine becasuse insight, by its nature, cannot be plotted out. 


## Let The Work Carry You Forward
Aim for a [[Flow state]], let the note-taking work develop momentum, let it energise you. 

Cultivate motivation and interest to stave off demotivation and procrastnation. 

Don't attempt to trick yoirself into work with [[External rewards]], this is an unreliable short-term fix. Instead **make the work rewarding so that a positive [[Feedback loop]] propels you forward.**

Only by getting timely and concrete feedback can we improve.
[[Seek feedback instead of asvoiding it]]. 

Cultivate a growth mindset according to psychologist [[Carol Dweck]] a growth mindset is the most reliable predictor of long-term success.
'To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positve or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run. Conversely, nothing is a bigger hindrance to personal growth than having a 'fixed mindset'.

There is a link here to [[Ego is the Enemy]]; one's ego can inhibit the desire to seek feedback.

Also related is [[Praising achievement over talent]]; those who are praised for their inate 'gifts' or 'talents' are at risk of developing a fixed mindset, by trying to keep this impression intact instead of 'exposing themselves to new challenges and the possiblity of learning from failure.' (Relevant is [[The Obstacle Is The Way]]).

**Growth mindset = getting pleasure out of changing for the better, instead of getting pleasure in being praised.** The former draws you to areas that need improvment, the latter draws you to safe, proven areas where you won't run into challenges. Not good! 

> 💡 Feedback loops are smaller than one big block of feedback at the end, so they are less intimidating and easier to accept and take on board.


Being able to write something in our own words is a great way to see if we understand it, further develop our understanding, and to remember the content. 

The ability to store info in our brains will decrease over time for *isolated facts*. We can improve our ability to store and recall information by making the info we have in our brains **more connected.**

The end goal here is **the optimal interaction/dynamic between our brains and our slip-box.**


# The Six Steps to Sucessful Writing

## 9 Separate and Interlocking Tasks
### 9.1 Give each task your undivided attention
The modern world is diminishing our ability to do undistracted work.
Cut down on distractions as much as possible in order to do mre focused worn.

### 9.2 Don't multitask
Different tasks in the writing process require different types of attention; not only can we not multi-task, we also can't work with more than one type of attention at once. 

We want to try and enter the [[Flow state]].

**Actionable items:**
- Avoid multitasking
- Preempt possible sources of distraction
- Separate tasks by type of attention required. Bulk work together


### 9.3 Give each tasks the right kind of attention
There are different types of attention, part of our efficiency will come from matching up the right task with the right attention type.
e.g. proofreading is a different mindset to attempting to find the right word to use. 
So it's important to know what stage you are at and what your current goal is, in order to use attenton correctly.
> 💡 Academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention.

Studies on the daily routines of Nobel Prize winners found it is the flexibility of their focus, and not their outright ability to deploy it, that distinguishes them. 

Of interest to us are **the external conditions** that allow for this flexibility; we can only be as flexible as the work structure we use; and [[The Slip-box]] is flexible by design.


### 9.4 Become an Expert, not a Planner
Planning alone will not lead us to writing excellence, as the nature of the work involves being open to insight, new lines of enquirty, and following our interest as it meanders between various topics. 

To be an expert is to be able to keep the work momentum going without trying to rely on a 'universally applicable rule about which step has to be taken when', as each topic, project, book, and work are different. The readers and writers are different too.

Remember this is both an intellectual and a creative endeavour; just as no step-by-step process exists for writing a song or finishing a marble scuplture, there is no one-size-fits-all guide to writing and note-taking. 

This can only be learned by doing and by practicing making our own decisions. 

This need for flexibility isn't always obvious and even evades teachers; studies have shown teachers 'tend to mistake the ability to follow their rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations.'

Experts know the underlying theory but also have enough **intuition** to deviate from the theory as and when needed. It is a [[Gut feeling]]; not a mysterious force but the instant, intuitive answer born of experience and history. 

### 9.5 Get closure
Out short-term memory is limited, we can free up space by offloading as much storage work as possible to our slip-box. 

Open tasks and projects exist as open loops in our head, floating around until
- It's forgotten
- Replaced by something more important (our brains decide this)
- Moved into long-term memory

This is called [[The Zeigarnik effect]] - open tasks tend to occupy our short-term membery until they are done or written down (in a way that convinced our brain that it will be taken care of later).

It is much easier to remember things that we understand. If we can link a new piece of information in with other info, if we can 'hang' it onto other info, we will remember it better. The more links/hooks/connections a piece of info has, the easier we can recall and remember it (though be aware of the cognitive bias [[The feature-positive effect]]).

So to make writing easier:
- Break it down into smaller tasks (helps overcome [[Kickstart inertia]])
