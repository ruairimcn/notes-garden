# Stage 2: Interrupted Attention and Overcoming Mind Wandering

## Summary
Stage Two involves the simple practice of keeping your attention on the breath - easuer said than done. You will discover that attention is easily captured by a distraction, making you forget that you're supposed to be paying attention to the breath. Forgetting quickly leads to mind-wandering, which can last a few seconds, several minutes, or the entire meditation session. 

This sequence is important: The untrained mind produces distractions that lead to forgetting, which results in mind-wandering. In this stage we only work with mind-wandering.

**Goals:** Shorten periods of mind-wandeirng and extend the periods of sustained attention to the meditation object.
**Obstacles:** Mind-wandering, monkey-mind, and impatience.
**Skills:** Reinforcing spontaneous [[Introspective Awareness]] and learning to sustain attention on the meditation object. 
**Mastery:** You can sustain attention on the meditation object for minutes, while most periods of mind-wandering last only a few seconds. 

### The Intention to Hold:
Willpower can't prevent the mind from forgetting the breath. Nor can you force yoruself to become aware that the mind is wandering. Instead, just hold the intention to appreciate the 'Aha!' moment that recognises mind-wandering, while gently but firmly redirecting attention back to the breath. Then, intend to engage with the breath as fully as possible without losing peripheral awareness. In time, the simple actions flowing from these three intentions will become mental habits. Periods of mind-wandering will become shorter, periods of attention to the breath will grow longer, and you'll have achieved your goal.
