# Conscious Experience and the Objectives of Meditation

This chapter introduces a basic, conceptual **model of Conscious Experience.**
As your practice improves, we'll move on to more in-depth models of the mind to work on, each building on the previous ones, and leading you towards the two major objectives of meditation practice: [[Meditation - Stable Attention]] and [[Mindfulness]].

[[Consciousness]] consists of whatever we're experiencing in the present moment. It's like vision: objects change from moment to moment, such as sights, sounds, smells, touch, taste. It also includes internal mental objects, which are transitory thoughts, feelings, and memories. 

## Attention and Peripheral Awareness
Conscious experience has two different forms, [[Meditation - Attention]] and [[Meditation - Peripheral Awareness]].

When we focus our **attention** on something, it dominates our conscious experience. But at the same time, we can be generally **aware** of things in the background. Right now your attention is focused on what you're reading, but you're, at the same time, aware of other sights, sounds, smells, etc, in the periphery. 

The way attention and peripheral awareness work together is a lot like visual focus and peripheral vision. If you've ever walked through a room of people, carrying tea, your visual focus is on the tea, making sure it doesn't spill. But your peripheral vision is watching out for people, tables, pets, etc. 

**It's important to realise attention and peripheral awareness are two different ways of 'knowing' the world.** Each has its virtues as well as shortcomings. 

In this book, when the term *awareness* is used, it refers to peripheral awareness. *It never means attention!* This distinction is key. Working with these two ways of knowing is how we cultivate [[Meditation - Stable Attention]] and [[Mindfulness]].
