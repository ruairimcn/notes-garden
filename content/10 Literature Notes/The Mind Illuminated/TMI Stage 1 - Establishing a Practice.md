# TMI Stage 1 - Establish a Practice

## Summary
This stage is about developing a consistent and diligent meditation practice. Being consistent means setting a clear daily schedule for when you're going to meditate, and sticking to it except when there are circumstances beyond your control. **Diligence** means engaging wholeheartedly in the practice rather than spending your time on the cushion planning or daydreaming.

**Goals:** Develop a regular meditation practice.
**Obstacles:** Resistance, procrastination, fatigue, impatience, boredom, lack of motivation.
**Skills:** Creating practice rotines, setting specific pracitce goals, generating strong motivation, cultivating discipline and diligence.
**Mastery:** Never missing a daily practice session.

### The Intention to Hold:
Put all your effort into forming and holding a conscious intention to sit down and meditate for a set period every day, and to practice diligently for the duration of the sit. When your intentions are clear and strong, the approproate actions naturally follow, and you'll find yourself regularly sitting down to meditate. If this doesn't happen, instead of chastising yourself and trying to force yourself to practice, work on strengthening your motivation and intentions.
