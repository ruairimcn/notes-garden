# Stage 3 - Extended Attention and Overcoming Forgetting

Stages Two and Three are similar, but mind-wandering gets shorter and shorter until it stops altogether. Forgetting is the biggest challenge but sleepiness can be a problem too.

**Goals:** Overcoming forgetting and falling asleep.
**Obstacles:** Distractions, forgetting, mind-wandering, and sleepiness.
**Skills:** Using the techniques of [[TMI - Following the Breath]] and [[TMI = Connecting]] to extend the periods of uninterrupted attention, and becoming familiar with how forgetting happens. Cultivating introspective awareness through the practices of [[Meditation - Labeling]] and [[Checking In]]. These techniques allow you to catch distractions **before** they lead to forgetting.
**Mastery:** Rarely forgetting the breath or falling asleep.


### The Intention to Hold:
Set your intention to invoke introspective attention frequently, **before** you've forgotten the breath or fallen asleep, and make corrections as soon as you notice distractions or dullness. Also, intend to sustain peripheral awareness while engaging with the breaht as fully as possible. These three intentions and the actions they produce are simply elaborations of those from [[TMI Stage 2 -  Interrpted Attention and Overcoming Mind Wandering]]. Once they become habits, you'll rarely forget the breath.
