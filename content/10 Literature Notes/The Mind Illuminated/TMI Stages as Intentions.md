# TMI Stages as Intentions

**Setting clear intentions:**
We naturally tend to think of ourselves as the agent responsible for producing results through will and effort. We believe we should be in control, masters of our own minds. This creates problems for meditation practice because it is not true. We are not in control. 

You cannot wilfully force the mind into submission. If you try to, you will inevitably fail and get discourages. This can turn into a habit unless you realise there is no 'self' in charge of the mind, and therefore nobody to blame. This fact of [[Insight into No-Self]] will become increasing clear as you continue to meditate, but you can't afford to wait for that Insight, so for the sake of making progress it is best to drop this notion, at least at an intellectual level, as soon as possible.	

In reality, all we're 'doing' in meditation is forming and holding specific conscious intention - nothing more. In fact, while it may not be obvious, all our achievements originate from intentions. Intentions repeatedly sustained over the course of many meditation sessions give rise to frequently repeated mental acts, which eventually become habits of the mind.

At every Stage, all 'you' really do is patiently and persistently hold intentions to respons in specific ways to whatever happens during your meditation. Setting and holding the right intentions is what's essential.

While useful, the lists of goals, obstacles, skills, and mastery provided for the Stages can obscure just how simple the underlying process really is: **Intentions lead to mental actions, and repeated mental actions become mental habits.** This simple formula is at the heart of every Stage.
