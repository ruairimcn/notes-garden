# Values
Every human being lives by a set of values and priorities that is unique to them, like a fingerprint.

What we spend time doing, what we pursue, our behavior, and our character, emerges from these values, and hence our values dictate our destiny, our path in life.

As our valued can change, our destiny can change, and our life is hence broken down into a series of stories or chapters.

The world needs all values so we have no universal value system. 

Give yourself permission to live alongside your values, and to not subordinate yourself to anyone else's values - be true to yourself. Stand out - you can't make a difference fitting in. 

Your highest value - and there can be only one - is an spontaneuous inner value that doesn't require external motivation. Martini's is teaching. 
As you go down the list of values, they become more extrinsic and hence require more motivation. 

> ðŸ’¡Motivation is never a solution for humanity, it is a symptom of an uninspired individual, who is not delegating their lower priorities in order to focus on their higher priorities.


Martini is not a motivational speaker, he wants to find what people want to do that requires no motivation. 

**Your identity revolves around your highest value.** This is your purpose, your mission. 

Your highest value dictates what you are aware of, what you allow into your conscious; a woman whose highest priority is mother will go into a mall and see childrens clothes, toys, books, etc.

Anything we don't value highly we will essentially have ADD with. 


Teleology - the study of meaning and purpose. 

Your vision and impact shrink when you don't live by and follow your highest value.

Don't confuse serving with pleasing. Do the former. 


# Relationships

You can improve your relationships with others by knowing what other people's values are. 

**Strive for equilibrium in relationships.** This means allowing yourself to be yourself, and the other person to be their self. Don't put them on a pedastle, don't see yourself as lower than them. And also don't put yourself above them, don't look down on them.
Balance. Equal. Yin Yang. This is the only way to build and sustain meaningful, long-term relationships. 


# Practical 
**Question:** *How are my partner's values helping me to fulfill what I'm dedicated to? *
Job as romantic partner, Patrick as business partner.
Also ask this the other way around for them. 

Am I projecting my values onto Job by not knowing her values? Does she know them herself? 

The only thing you can ever expect a human being to do is to live by their values. 

You must communicate your values to your partner in terms of their values. 

1. Live by your priorities
2. Communicate what is important to you, to your partner, in terms of what is important to them.  


Are you supporting or challenging their values? 

All relationships strive for androgeny, a balance between traditional masculine and feminine roles.
