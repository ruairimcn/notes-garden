Ron Crouch is an American psychologist living in Europe who also teaches [[Samatha Vipassana Meditation]].

His website was not active for many years and as of April 2021 the domain appears to have lapsed so the website was down.

I found the info on his website very useful, particularly regarding [[The Path of Insight]], and his explanations in general are very good.

Luckily, an eBook was put together by mahasivipassana.com, I have read it and it seems to be an accurate source of material that used to be on his website.

Note that even though this PDF and its contents are freely accessible, their copyright holder is Ron Crouch.
