Changa is a form of [[DMT]] that has been infused with plant matter in order to make it more easily smokable; in this form it is like [[Cannabis]] and can be smoked as a joint, in a pipe, bong, etc.

Strictly speaking, changa must include ayahuasca vine to be called changa, thought it can be found without the vine too. The presence of the vine contains MAOI which slows down the rate at which one's body metabolizes DMT, making the trip last longer.

Changa tends to be less intense than DMT on its own (called freebase DMT) and it is easier to smoke, so I think it is a good introduction to DMT, and to [[Psychedelics]] in general as it is a short-lasting trip (when not taken with an MAOI).
