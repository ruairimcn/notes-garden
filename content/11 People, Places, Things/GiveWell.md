# GiveWell
[GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/) is a charity that researches and looks into other charities, with the goal of keeping a list of highly effective charities **that save the most lives per dollar.**

From their website:

'We search for the charities that save or improve lives the most per dollar.

Our goal is to produce the world's top research on where to give. Free, for everyone.

We recommend a small number of charities that do an incredible amount of good.'

Donating to them is a good way to practice [[Effective Altruism]]
