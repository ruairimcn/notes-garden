Internet Off By Default is a principle and experiment I am beginning to conduct beginning 2021-09-09.

# The Principle
The guiding principle is this:

**Internet connectivity will remain turned off on all of my digital devices by default.**
I will turn it on only after writing down/typing 
- What I am going to use it to accomplish
- Roughly how long I will use it for
Once the time is up or the task is accomplished, I wll turn the internet off.

I can use it for leisure as well as work but must write down that this is the purpose of turning it on, and must put a time limit on it.


# The Log
My Internet Log, where I write down what I will turn the internet on for and for how long, will be put into each day's Daily Note.

I will keep a public blog post about how this experiment goes here:
