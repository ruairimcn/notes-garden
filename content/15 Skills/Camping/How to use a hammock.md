Some advice on using a hammock

# Clean your feet first 
If your feet have dirt and grit on them, this will come off as your feet rub on the inside of the hammock, and since hammocks sag down this dirt will pool in the middle and irritate your skin. 

# Hang it with a good sag
Don't string up your hammock too tightly or it will squeeze your shoulders and back. Hang it with a sag, e.g. it should look like a smiley face :) 

This also lowers the center of gravity, making it harder to fall out.


# Lay diagonally
This is how hammocks were designed to be used, and it's comfier!

# Raise your feet higher
This will help to stop you sliding to the middle of the hammock (as opposed to laying diagonally).
This also lets you benefit from [[The benefits of sleeping with your legs raised]]



# Stay dry with a drip line
Water can come down the hammock suspension lines in heavy rain and soak your hammock. Prevent this with a simple rope/line that hangs down, causing water to drip down this instead of down the suspension line to your hammock.

# Use a bug net
The importance of this one varies on your location; I'm in [[Thailand]] so a bug net is essential to avoid being a snack for mosquitos. Some hammocks have them built in.


# Be Safe
- The higher you hang your hammock, the more dangerous it will be if it falls. The guide referenced below under **Sources** advises that you don't hang a hammock more than 3 feet off the ground.
- Related to this is to not hang your hammock over anything dangerous; rocks, water, holes in the ground, etc.
- Don't stack hammocks vertically.
