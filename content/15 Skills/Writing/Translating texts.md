# Translating texts
Translating texts is an area that interests me as what could be seen as a relatively simple task - understanding two languages and translating a text from one to the other - is more interesting and involved than I originally assumed, given the vast differences in languages, colloqualisms, and cultures.

An interesting quote from Legends of the Condor Heros by Anna Holmwood who translated it from Chinese to English is
> ðŸ’¬ 'The greatest loss that can occur in translation can only come from not translating at all.'
