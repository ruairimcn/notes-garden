Basecamp is a [[Project management]] tool that I use for web design project management.

It is a tool that is popular for its simplicity; it is so simple that your clients can use it, letting you replace email once a deal has been closed.

For more about how I use it on my 5-man [[Freelance Collective]] tea [[Propeller Digital]], see [[Web design project management with Basecamp]]

# Overview
**Cost:** $99 p/m as of July 2021. Free personal plan.
There are no limits on projects, users, or clients.

## Pros
- It is very simple to use; your team will get to grips with it in minutes, and your clients can too if you choose to add in clients
- It is suited to using either fully internally, externally, or some mix of these, i.e. it's great whether you use it with clients or not.
- You can enable or disable features as needed
- Perfect for replacing emails for project communication
- 


## Cons
Occasionally it can be a bit too simple;
- Shift+Enter adds in these annoying grey indented bars instead of a line break
- There is no Vacation Autoresponder
- There are some places emojis can be used but only a very small selection of them are available to be used instead of all of them
