I think [[Basecamp]] can work well as a simple [[CRM]] for [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]], saving you money on a paid CRM.
For a few months I used [[OnePage CRM]] and found it useful, but for cash-strapped freelancers with a simple sales process, Basecamp can work well.

# Setting up Basecamp as a CRM

## 1: Create a 'Sales CRM' team
Create a new Team that is just for sales.

## 2: For each new lead
1. Forward any relevant lead/sales emails into the Team. Use this as the main comment area where sales are discussed (or just for notes if you're working solo).
2. Make a ToDo list for each new lead where you track your calls, emails, and next move. **Always have an upcoming task for each lead you are working on, even if it's a simple as 'Follow up in two weeks if no reply.'** Always be trying to move leads through your [[Sales Funnel]]
3. That's it. You can store relevant files like invoices and quotes in Docs and Files, use the Message Board for broader sales discussions with your team, track sales people's progress with Automatic Questons, and see your sales due dates in Schedule.
