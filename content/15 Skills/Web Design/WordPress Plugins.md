[[WordPress]] plugins are 'add-ons' for WordPress that you can buy or get for free, that add additional functionality to the WordPress website.

The range of functionality they can add varies widely; the quality and quantity of available WordPress plugins is a large reason for his popularity.

**Examples of plugins:**
| Plugins  | Description |
| WooCommerce | Adds basic eCommerce functionality for physical and digital products |
| Elementor | Popular responsive drag-and-drop page builder plugin |
| Really Simple SSL | Enables SSL/HTTPS site-wide |
| Forminator | For building forms of various types and layouts |

Plugins have a downside; they sometimes have security vulnerabilities that can be used by hackers to compromise a website to varying degrees depending on the severity of the security flaw.
At my [[Freelance Collective]] [[Propeller Digital]], we have our websites connected to a service called [[ManageWP 1]], and part of what this does is, several times a day, cross-references all plugins on all connected websites against a database of known WordPress plugin vulnerabilities, and flags vulnerable plugins so that we can update them ASAP.

Plugins can be used with other plugins surprisignly well **most** of the time, but sometimes conflicts can arise, slowing or breaking a website. In scenarios like this you need to do a [[Plugin Deactivation Debug]]
