This note will explore how I use [[Basecamp]] for web design [[Project management]].
It is part of my course [[Getting started with Freelance WordPress Web Design]]

# Why use Basecamp at all?
In complex project work like web design, it is best to have an organized and efficient system for tracking, progressing, and talking about projects with their respective clients.

The default today is to use email for this work. **But email is not an efficient project management tool.**
- Everything is mixed in to one inbox; leads, invoices and receipts, client replies, tax alerts, etc. Even if you use folders and labels, you are still mixing a lot of info around in one main space in one tool.
- Email is not designed for long conversations; once an email thread/chain starts to go past about 20 emails or so, it gets difficult to move around inside them as everything is getting multiplied with each reply, including people's email signatures. Threads get long, messy and hard to navigate.
- Anyone from anywhere in the world can add to your inbox. It is not good to be seeing emails coming in while you are working on a project, say if the project info is in an email and you need to reference it. No matter how strong your powers of attention and focus are, it is simply not good to have distractions like this coming in and breaking your focus.
- It's simply not the best tool for the job, and this will become more obvious and painful as your client base grows.
- Email is simply the wrong tool for the job, not a bad tool. It is great for short conversations. At Propeller Digital, sales discussions happen over email, and once we agree to start a project with the client, we change over to Basecamp.


There are many project manangement tools, subscriptions, and plugins that can solve some or all of the above issues, common ones include the below list. I'm not saying Basecamp is the best answers for everyone, but I think for [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]], it is one of the best options and it has served my team and I (and our clients) very well for over 16 months. 

**Alternative project management software:**
- Asana
- Clickup
- Monday.com
- Slack
- Trello
- Google Sheets
- and many others...


# What does Basecamp do?
Basecamp lets you make 'buckets' - a collection of people and data - either as Teams (for internal collaboration) and Projects (for external collaboration with clients). Inside each bucket you can have any mix of the following Features enabled (roughly ordered from most to least important for the way I use it):
- *Message Board*. Replaces emails. Any user can post a message and others can comment on it. Much easier to use and read than long chains of emails.
- *To-do Lists.* Lets you create lists of ToDo items that can be assigned a due date, users involved, and is also like a Message in that users can comment on it. 
- *Docs and Files*. Easy storage, sharing of, and discussion on various files and documents. Can easily link to documents in Dropbox or Google Drive. 
- *Campfire*. A simple chat room, good for quick questions/comments that don't need their own Message.
- *Schedule*. A shared calendar. Useful as it can show ToDo due dates. Low on list as its often replaced by Google Calendar. 
- *Email forwards*. Allows emails to be forwarded in to a specific project where they can be discussed like a Message. Low on list as I don't use it much but when I do it's great, and if you have clients who prefer email you may end up using this a lot and loving it.
- *Automatic Questions/Check-ins*. Allows you to ask recurring questions of everyone on a team/project, e.g. we have:
	- Every Monday, team asked 'What are you doing this week?'
	- Every Friday, team asked 'What did you do this week?'
	- First Monday of each month: 'Have you read any good books lately? 
	meant to a kind of replacement for standup meetings.


You can enable or disable these tools as needed.



## Using Basecamp with Clients
Basecamp lets you add an unlimited number of team members and clients to an unlimited number of projects or teams.

**Projects** are where you can add clients. 
Once you add a client you have the following control:
- You can delete their account if needed for some reason
- You can choose to share individual Messages with them, or keep them private. You can also do with to-do lists, documents, and folders; you control what your client sees.
- You can choose to share the entire campfire chat room with your client or not
This lets you use a Project for both internal team communication, and external client communication. There is room for error here but Basecamp does an excellent job of showing you what is hidden and what is visible to your client.

I personally wouldn't use Basecamp if I was not sharing access with clients, as for me this is what makes it better than its competitors is its simplicity and ease of use for clients. It makes project management involving clients a good experience, and good project management is about getting work done with as least pain and friction as possible. 


## How our Basecamp is structured.
Our Basecamp ('our' being [[Propeller Digital]]) is used by two distinct groups:

### Propeller Team
*Our team* of five web designers. General items go into our 'Team HQ' and we have Teams created for specific 'activities', kind of like 'departments':
- Billing and Invoicing
- Sales CRM (See [[Using Basecamp as a CRM]])
- Process Improvement
- Management 
- and more



### Clients
We create a *Project* for each *Client*. Generally this is for a new website but we will also create them for any sort of hourly work we do for a business as this keeps everything organized.

We typically use the following features only, though the others are occasionally used:
- **Message Board.** Replaces email.
- **ToDos**. Task management, we sometimes assign tasks to clients too.
- **Docs and Files**. File storage. We usually use Google Docs and Sheets as they are better and have real-time collaboration. We find this area best as an area for the client to give us files we need like logo, text docs, photos, etc. 
- **Campfire**. We add the client to the campfire chat. 

From here it's just a matter of working out your own style and method, and following it. Sometimes you'll need to sway clients towards using email, sometimes they won't budge and you might end up only using Basecamp internally, but this can be great too, just forward the client's emails into Basecamp automatically with an email filter.



### Templates
Templates are a powerful feature in Basecamp that let you create new Projects or Teams via a template.

As an example we use the following template for web design clients:
- Private ToDo lists are created that have our internal process for us to follow, e.g. billing 50%, creating staging website, mainly a comprehensive 'Go Live/Website Launch' checklist to follow. 
- Folders pre-setu-up for content, e.g. 'Text Content', 'Branding', 'Photos'.
- We don't pre-fill the Messages Board with anything currently but I think it could be good to have onboarding info for clients here. 


This mainly saves us time duplicating in ToDo lists as the majority of the heavy lifting being done here by the template are these lists.


### Emails and Notifications
Basecamp has a couple of settings for users around emails and notifications; while you may end up living inside of Basecamp if you use it regularly, your clients won't, so they will likely see updates via emails and then click into Basecamp. 


### And That's All, Doc!
There isn't much else to Basecamp than this; get used to it (in minutes), and have a simple but detailed plan for using Basecamp with clients. It's power will grow from here.

It's simple but I believe this is the best feature a core piece of software like this needs to have. You can add on other services and tools as needed, and can make these work together with the likes of Zapier and WebHooks. In my opinion it is better to start simple and add on as needed, as opposed to starting off with an overly complex tool.
