According to the book [[The Visual MBA]], 
'Leadership is more than management. It's about inspiring change and improving results through who you are and how you motivate others.

**What is leadership to me?**
Sometimes it is hard to make a decision on how to proceed, given the amount of variables and uncertainty in this world of ours. Alas, decisions have to be made. A leader is someone who takes responsibility for leading a group of people into the future in order to succeed at meeting one or more goals. 
To me, a good leader exercises [[Extreme Ownership]] - they take full responsibility.

*Lack of ownership:* 'We failed to meet our goal because some of our important team members got complacent towards the end.'
*Extreme ownership:* 'We failed to meet our goal because I failed to motivate and encourage the team to keep the pressure up right until the deadline.'

# Change the context to change people
This is similar to the idea of human's being highly influenced by their environment.
'Although it is hard to change people, nothing changes people faster than changing their environment.'


# Manage energy, not time
Applies to you and people you lead.


# Eustress VS Distress
A certain amount of positive stress - eustress - is good, it helps us to grow and adapt.
However, it will eventually reach the point of [[Diminishing Returns]] and will become negative distress.
