# The benefits of having plants indoors
There is a growing body of research and science that says nature is good for us - seeing it, being in it, a simple walk in a forest is good for your mental and physical health.

There are also benefits to bringing nature indoors and having plants inside.

If you're not convinced, [here is a list of studies on this topic](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/health-and-wellbeing/articles/resources-and-further-reading).


# Benefits according to Washington State University
This university's Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture published a paper titled What Are the Benefits of Plants Indoors and Why Do We Respond Positively to Them?

[Here is the PDF link](https://public.wsu.edu/~lohr/pub/2010LohrBenefitsPltsIndoors.pdf).

#ToStudy - the rest of this paper. 

## Benefits on indoor air quality
1. **Reduce air pollutants.** Some plants can reduce air pollutants. Varies based on the plant.
2. **Improve relative humidity.** Foilage plants can raise relative humidity to healthier and more comfortable levels indoors. 
3. **Reduce particulate matter.** Fine particles like dust can be reduced by plants.
4. **Better [[Acoustics]].** Plants can improve sound acoustics, similar to adding carpet to a room. Good for music, recording, etc.


## Benefits on well-being
1. **Feelings improve.** Plants can improve people's attentiveness, feelings of happiness, and feelings of playfulness
2. **Stress reduction.** Plants, and photos of plants, can produce a calming and stress-reducing effects similar to nature outdoors.


## Productivity 
Productivity has been shown to be higher when plants are present. People respond quicker - reaction time is lowered. Mental fatigue is lowered too. 



## Health improvement 
 1. **Pain reduction.** People have been found to recover quicker from surgery and use less doses of strong pain medication if their hospital room has a view of trees.
 2. **Reduced general discomfort.** Office workers in Norway, when foilage plants were added to the office, were found to report less physical issues/symptoms, such as coughing and fatigue. Elderly residents of an assisted living facility 'reported significantly improved feelings of health after working with the plants.'


### The science behind these benefits
This study from Washington State University discusses the science behind these findings which I will note here:

1. Plants can reduce stress levels. Participants in a study were asked to either repot a house plant or do a short computer-based task. The former lowered the stress responsive in participants, the latter caused a spike in heart rate and blood pressure (even though the group was made up of young men used to computer work).
2. Real plants sharpen your attention compared to fake ones, photos of plants, or no plant at all.
3. Working with plants can help people to deal with [[Depression]], anxiety, dementia, and other conditions. In some places in England, working with plants is advised for people dealing with mental health issues.
4. Plants may help people recover from illness faster.
5. Plants may boost your productivity.
6. Plans may improve your outlook on work. **Personally** I have found working outdoors in nature to be much better for my mood and focus than working indoors. [[I love working outdoors]].
7. Plants may improve indoor air quality.
