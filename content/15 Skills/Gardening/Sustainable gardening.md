### Try not to buy online
The rise of online retail has seen large plant retailers begin selling online. Beware of ordering plants online and having a lot of fossil fuels burned just to get a plant to your front door. Buy locally where possible. 


### Reuse plastic pots
Plastic pots are hard to recycle, only 10% of local authorities in the UK will accept them.
- They are considered contaminated
- They are made from black plastic which sorting machines in recycling centres cannot detect. 

**Solutions:**
- Reuse and repair plastic pots where possible 
- Use taupe pots (easier to recycle)
- Use biodegradable pots 



### Avoid peat
Peat is found in compost, but it's not sustainable to use as it takes thouysands of years to form and 

'Commercial extraction can remove over 500 years-worth of growth in a single year," says Dr Dines, of British conservation charity Plantlife.'


### Avoid short-living plants
Some plants are 'designed to die' like Poinsettias and sprayed cacti.


### Propagate plants from cuttings and seeds
Better to make your own new plants from cuttings and seeds instead of buying and transporting existing ones.
