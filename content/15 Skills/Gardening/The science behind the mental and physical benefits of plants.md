# The science behind the mental and physical benefits of indoor plants
This note is a supplementary note to
[[The benefits of having plants indoors]].
It examines the science behind these benefits, as per the research paper [What Are the Benefits of Plants Indoors and Why Do We Respond Positively to Them?](https://public.wsu.edu/~lohr/pub/2010LohrBenefitsPltsIndoors.pdf)

[[Are plants good for us, or is it that the modern world is bad for us and nature is our baseline?]]

# Why we respond to plants
The article points out that people developed alongside of nature - indeed, we are a part of nature. This is it reasonable to assume we would have developed 'cues to factors in our surroundings related to nature and our survival.'

The article asks **'We know that people respond to day length. Why shouldn't people also respond to other aspects of nature, such as plants and the weather?**


## Behavioural Ecology
It is believed that this positive response to nature is influenced by both innate and learned factors, i.e. genotype and phenotype.

The main evidence for this is:
Adults and children are shown photos of different biomes.
Adults expressed preferences for both the African savanna, as well as photos of their home bios (e.g. forest). The young children showed a preference only for the savanna. 

So it's possible children are showing an inmate/genotype preference, and adults show this as well as a learned/phenotype preference. 

### Locating a good habitat 
Now the question is why these genotypes exist, and why these phenotypes develop.

The theory put forward by this article is that they developed in order to help us find resource-rich habitats.
[[Hunter-Gatherer|Hunter-gatherers]] depended on their habit for survival. A habitat that was low-risk - low chance of death while looking for food, good shelter from predators and the environment - was a huge benefit for survival. And since organisms try to expend the least amount of energy possible to achieve a task or goal (as this aids in survival - [[Organisms are energy saving]]), it was beneficial to be able to quickly recognize good habitats. 

#### Environmental cues 
The article then goes into detail on how certain types of trees were better for survival, particularly those in the Savanna, hence why we react positively to this environment or photos of it.

**Possible cues:**
1. **Tree form.** People respond more positively to scenes with trees, particularly trees with denser canopies, broader than they are tall, and trunks short to relative tree height. These trees are easier to climb for spotting prey or avoiding predators. 
2. **Color.** Studies show that all tree colors are calming but healthy green trees are more calming than other colors like yellow and less bright green, possibly because darker greens usually meant a tree or plant is healthier. 
3. **Species diversity.** Well-being is positively correlated with a diverse range of plant species. Likely because a habitat with only one or a handful of species were likely to be of a lower quality.
4. **Fractals.** [[Fractals]] - forms with patterns that repeat as the form is magnified - are abundant in nature, e.g. branching in trees. Human vision 'is attuned to fractal patterns... there is growing evidence that people exhibit lower levels of stress when looking at images with fractal patterns, natural or not.' ^395c98
