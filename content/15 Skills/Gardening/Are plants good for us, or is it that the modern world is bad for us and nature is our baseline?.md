# Are plants good for us, or is it that the modern world is bad for us and nature is our baseline?

There is much research behind plants being better for us, suggesting we should have many more of them in indoor spaces.

I think the correct way to phrase this is that a lack of plants, or nature in general, is bad for us. We're not urban animals who benefit from more plants, we are outdoors, wilderness animals who suffer mentally and physically when we are away from plants.
