# Caring for potted plants

# The Basics
According to [Patuxent Nursery](https://patuxentnursery.com/blog/keep-potted-plants-alive/:)

## 1: Choose the correct pot
- A pot should have one ore more holes in the bottom for excess water to drain out, otherwise the plant can drown.
- Plants need space to grow, this includes the **roots.** If there is not enough room for the roots to grow, they won't be able to support the foilage on top (this is called *top heave*) and it will wither and die. 
	- I am unsure how to know if a plant's roots need more room and needs to be re-potted in a bigger pot. #UnansweredQuestion 

## 2: Use good potting soil
When you need to re-pot, a shovel of dirt from the garden won't suffice - buy potting soil. Often they contain nutrients and/or fertilizer to help keep it healthy and strong. Some species of plants have specific potting soils that are made to work wel with them.


## 3: Not too much and not too little water

## 4: Give them plenty of sunlight
Plants have different preferences for shade VS sun, but every plant needs some amount of sunlight.


## 5: Watch out for pets
Some pets will eat or tear up plants. And there are some plants with are poisonous to animals.


## 6: Know thy plants.
Know what species of plants you have and learn about them:
- How much sun and shade?
- How much water?
- Pruning?
- Fertilizer?

## Deadheading
This is where you 'pinch off' dead blossoms. It's not required as they will eventually fall off on their own, but it looks better quicker and more importantly encourages growth.


## Consider the rain
Plants need less watering if it rains a lot.
Heavy rains may damage or drown plants. 


## Beware of pests
Animals, big and small, love to eat plants.
Fences and hanging baskets are good here.
