# Potted Plants
## Not too much, not too little.
It is possible to drown plants! Roots will rot if left in saturated soil.

Every plant species is different so you need to read up on them, but in general you can check if a plant needs water via the soil and leaves.

**In general:** [^1]
- Feel the soil near the edge of the pot. 
	- Dry and crumbly = time to water
	- Damp = probably doesn't need more water
- Water a plant unitl water begins to run out the holes in the pots, or until the soil no longer absorbs water/pools on the top.
- If a plant is wilted and droopy but the soil is damp, there is likely a drainage problem that is drowning the plant.
