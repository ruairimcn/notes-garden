# 1: Goal
*What's your business goal? What are you trying to achieve? Anything you write should always be aligned with a larger (business or marketing) goal - even an individual blog post.*

# 2: Reframe for the reader
*Reframe the idea to relate it to your readers. Why does it matter to them? What's in it for them? Why should they care? What's the clear lesson or message you want them to take away? What value do you offer them? What questions might they have? What advice or help can you provide.*


# 3: Seek out data and examples




# 4: Organise
*What is the structure? Narrative? Outline? *

# 5: Write to one person
*That person is...*

# 6: Produce The Ugly First Draft (TUFD). 
*Show up and throw up. Write badly. Write as if no one will ever read it (Stephen King calls this 'writing with the door closed.'). Don't worry about grammar, complete sentences, or readability. Don't fret about spelling or usage, you'll tackle that all later. For now just get that TUFD down.*

*This phase is often where many bloggers end the process. But you won't do that, because you have respect both for your writing and for your reader.*


# 7: Walk away.
*Put distance between you and your writing.*

# 8: Rewrite.
*Shape that mess into something that a reader wants to read. In your head, swap places with your reader as you do so. (See Rule 10)*

# 9: Give it a great headline or title.


# 10: Have someone edit. 


# 11: One final look for readability.
*Does your piece look inviting, alluring, easy to scan? With short paragraphs and bold subheads? Are your lists numbered or bulleted? For the most part, chunky blocks of text feel impenetrable and don't convey enough energy and movement. Bulky text doesn't look fun to read.*

# 12: Publish, but first answer one more reader question: *what now? 
*Don't leave your reader just standing awkwardly in the middle of the dance floor after the music stops. What do you want them to do next?*
    - Check out other resources?
    - Sign up to hear more?
    - Register for an event or a free trial?
    - Buy something?

*Consider the order of the steps in this writing process merely a suggestion - you can toss them around and follow them in any order you wish. It's all at your discretion!*
