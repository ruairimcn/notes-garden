This website is a public directory of all my notes stored using a service called [[Obsidian]]. It is something of a digital 🧠 'second brain' where I will be storing and **connecting** notes on topics I am interested in. Learn more ℹ️ [[About this website and how to navigate it]].

These notes are all a work in progress, as I'm following the principle of 🚪 [[Work with the garage door up]].
