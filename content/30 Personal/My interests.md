# My interests
My interests are areas, topics, and skills that I am interested in and spend time learning about or doing. They are a level below [[My priorities]], meaning I don't actively pursue them daily. e.g. meditation is a priority and done daily, drumming is an interest and done a few times a week.


# 🥁 Music
I am interested in music and listen to it regularly. I have very few personal monthly subscriptions, the one I have had the longest and used the most is [[Spotify]].

I play the [[Drumming|Drums]] and I practice [[Singing]]. I spend less time drumming and singing than I used to as work and travel has taken up more of my time recently. I used to play and perform in musicals and bands - one day I shall return! 


# 🧗Rock Climbing
I enjoy rock climbing and bouldering, indoors and outdoors.
