I think it was roughly 2018 or so when I came across Minimalism. I didn't decide there and then 'I'm a minimalist!', but the concept stuck with me and I gradually came to own less and less possessions at the years went by. It was also reinforced by my study of [[Buddhism]] as it claims that outside, external things cannot make us truly or lastingly happy - if that's true, which I believe it to be, then why spend time and money on objects that then clutter up your house?

I also adopted it for practical reasons; I travelled to Thailand 3 times and to Portugal once for a total of 17 months living abroad at the date this note was created. [[Travel light]] is a motto from the [[Boy Scouts]] that stuck with me, and I spent those 17 months with just this backpack shown below. When living from a bag this size minimalism is no longer a choice!

Being someone who works a lot with digital tools and content also helps me to practice minimalism as much of my time each day is spent on some kind of computer, so there is less time in the day to spend pursuing material items. 


## Things I own much less of than the average person
- [[Clothes and Me|Clothes]]


## Things I'm not minimal about
[[Books]]. I regularly purchase both digital and physical books and I don't worry about having too many of them.
[[Board games]]. I don't buy as many board games as I do books but as I enjoy playing them I don't worry about owning too many.
