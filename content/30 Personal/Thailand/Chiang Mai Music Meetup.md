# Summary
Chiang Mai Music Meetup is a small group [[Ruairi McNicholas|I]] have created in order to regularly play music with other musicians in Chiang Mai.

I have a music room in my house in Chiang Mai Lakeland Village, near Wat Umong, east of the airport.

I'm open to playing most genres of music, though my preference is for rock and funk. 
I am happy to just jam, or to have a go at originals if we get a consistent group going.

Due to size and equipment constraints I will probably cap the group at 8-10 members (there's room for about 6-7 but not everyone will be able to make it each week).


# Equipment
- Two microphones with stands
- Electric drum kit
- Acoustic guitar with pickup
- Ukelele
- Small electric keyboard
- iPad with Garageband
- Speaker system
- Mixer (instruments > mixer > speakers)

Members are welcome to bring their own instruments.

# Meetup
Currently I am regularly available to meet up for 2-4 hours every Saturday and/or Sunday, depending on what suits other people. Weekday meetups will be possible some weeks. 



# Joining 
The group communicates using a free tool called Basecamp, accessible via web browser or free computer/phone/tablet app.
