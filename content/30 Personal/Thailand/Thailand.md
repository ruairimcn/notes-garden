Thailand is a country in South-east Asia.

# Personal Relation
[[Ruairi McNicholas|I]] have been living in Thailand for over a year now across three trips
- 7 months in [[Chiang Mai]] in 2019
- 3 months in Bangkok in 2020, intended to stay all year but returned home due to COVID-10
- 4+ months as of writing (Jan to May 2021) in Chiang Mai. Current plan is to live here for 3+ years.

As such many of my notes on [[Buddhism]] and [[Meditation]] are influenced by the lens through which I see the world from living in Thailand, e.g. most of my experience is with the [[Theravada]] school of Buddhism which prevails here in Thailand, as opposed to the [[Mahayana]] school, popular in Tibet, China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Mongolia.
