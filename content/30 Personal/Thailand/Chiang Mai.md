# Chiang Mai
Chiang Mai is a city and province in Northern [[Thailand]]. 
It is the second largest province in Thailand and the largest city in Northern Thailand.
It is a popular destination for [[Digital Nomads]] and young people working from their laptops in general. It's also popular amongst tourists of al ages. 

You can find plenty about Chiang Mai online so the below is my personal take on it.

# Why I love Chiang Mai
1. **Low cost of living.**
2. **Beautiful, scenic, lots of nature.** Most of Chiang Mai's large population lives in the greater/larger area; the inner city itself really doesn't feel like the second-biggest city in the country. It feels small and intimate. There are many many **temples**, lots of parks, hill hiking trails, and waterfalls. There are very few huge/super tall buildings. Trees are abundant. Bangkok is a 'concrete jungle', Chiang Mai is a city in **the jungle.**
3. **Chill and relaxed.** I find it to be a very laid-back city. Quiet and peaceful.
4. **Lots to see and do.** Every type of restaurant you could want, shopping malls, cinemas, board game cafes, sports parks, outdoor rock climbing, [[Meditation Retreats]], the list goes on.
5. **Great weather.** For most of the year, [[Smokey season]] from around March to April/May is not nice or healthy.
6. **Safe.**
7. **Great for remote work.** Plenty of cafes and a few great co-working spaces. Fast internet.
8. **Great people.** In general the people are great - smiley and friendy. Good expat community too.
