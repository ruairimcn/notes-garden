# Summary
Chiang Mai Meditation Meetup is a small group [[Ruairi McNicholas|I]] have created in order to 
- discuss meditation with others who are interested in it
- practice together 
- build rapport and keep each other accountable to meditating daily

I will be capping the group at about eight people in order to keep it small and personal. 



# Meetup
The meetup will take place on Saturday or Sunday each week, depending on what suits most people.

The format is flexible but will likely go like this:
- 10 minute chat and catchup
- 30 minute meditation
- 30 minute chat and discussion about meditation
- 30 minutes afterwards for general chat and tea

I will likely host the meetup at my house in Chiang Mai Lakeland Village, east of the airport and near to Wat Umong, though I am open to hosting it elsewhere once the location is quiet, peaceful, and ideally free. 

The meetup is free, unless we decide to meet somewhere that has to be rented. 

I do not act as a 'teacher', merely an interested student of meditation who wants to improve at the art and skill of meditation by practicing it and discussing it with others. 

There is no pressure to share one's experience, people are welcome to sit in silence and listen. 


# Meditation style
The group is open to anyone practicing any type or style of meditation, though the 30 minute meditation will be done in silence.

My personal practice is mostly based on the books [[The Mind Illuminated]] and [[The Way of Liberation]], as well as the [[Waking Up App]] by [[Sam Harris]]


# Joining 
The group communicates using a free tool called Basecamp, accessible via web browser or free computer/phone/tablet app.
