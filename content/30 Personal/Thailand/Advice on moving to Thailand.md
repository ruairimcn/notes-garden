As of May 2021 it is possible to move to or visit Thailand for most nationalities/countries, though you are looking at a 7 to 15 day hotel quarantine depending on how COVID is doing in Thailand, the country you come from, and if you're vaccinated or not.

# Summary
Moving to Thailand is going to **cost you time and money**. That's all, if you can deploy those two resources well, you can come and live in The Land of Smiles!

## Time
- You will have to prepare all the documents needed to enter thailand with a [[Certificate of entry to Thailand]] (COE). This includes:
	- Booking and paying for a 2 week quarantine hotel,
	- Booking and paying for your flight to Thailand,
	- Paying for a specific type of COVID-related insurance ,
	- Putting all of the above info into the COE application website.
- You will have to spend several hours in transit to Thailand, varies by where you live,
- You will, depending on when you travel and where from, have to spend 14/15 days in a quarantine hotel where you're not allowed to leave your room for the majority of your stay.


## Money
Item cost is ballpark.

| Item                          | Cost   |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| Quarantine hotel 2 weeks      | €1,000 |
| One-way flight                | €500  |
| Health Insurance              | €100   |
| COVID Test                    | €100   |
| Buses, taxis, etc             | €100   |
| Visa                          | €100   |
| SIM card and snacks for hotel | €60    |
| 1 months expenses Thailand    | €600   |
| Extra/safety net cash         | €500   |
| **Total**                         | €3,060       |


So €3,000 is the amount you will want saved (in my humble opinion having lived here over a year) to pull the trigger on a move to Thailand.

**Visas:** Some countries (Ireland and UK included) at time of writing 23rd May 2021, can enter Thailand without a visa. This is currently a 45 day window that you can extend at least once for 30 days and possibly another 30 (the visa situation is ever-changing here.)

Visa-free is a good option if you plan to transition to a [[1 Year 1k Thai Visa]].

Otherwise the **[[Special Tourist Visa]]** is about €100 and lasts 3 months but can be extended for three more two times, for a total of 9 months. It's the most cost-effective method currently, the only disadvantage is having to apply for it through a Thai consulate or embassy, as opposed to just rocking up without a visa. This needs careful timing as depending on where you live, it can take one to two months to get your passport and visa back in the post.


# Next Steps
€3,000, a day's work prepping your entry requirements, and 2 weeks in a hotel room - this is is the cost of entry to Thailand as of 23rd May 2021. It is likely only worth it for people buying a one-way ticket; not many people will do all of that for one month here, I sure wouldn't! 

I was happy to pay the financial and time costs as I intend to be living here for several years.

If you are still interested in moving here:
1. Start saving cash!
2. Find the website of your Thai embassy or consulate in your country. Follow their instructions on how to get a visa (or not if you opt to not get it) and how to apply for the [[Certificate of entry to Thailand]] (COE)



# Living in Thailand
## Cost of living
This is at the lower end of living here; simple condo and simple bike/moped, eating out daily (not cooking).

| Item                       | Monthly cost |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Condo                      | €200         |
| Moped                      | €50          |
| Food                       | €200         |
| Water                      | €10          |
| Phone and internet         | €30          |
| General living, toiletries | €30          |
| Fuel, transport            | €30          |
| Buffer/emergency           | €100          |
| **Total**                  | €650             |


It's possible to get a less-snazzy condo for €100 a month, food could go down to €150 if you eat cheap every day and up to €300 if you eat out more.

€650 is a good minimum, any lower than this and IMO you are playing too close to the edge!

The stakes are higher out here, the risks from going broke are higher out in a foreign country away from home, so don't forget that! 

You'll likely want spending money, likely have some online bills like Spotify and/or Netflix, and likely want to save some money, so €1,000 a month is a better goal IMO.


## Pros and Cons
You can find plenty on the good and bad of Thailand online, this is just my personal take on it.

**Cons:**
The two primary cons are health/life-expectancy related:
1. **High road traffic deaths.** Thailand tends to move between 1st and 4th place globally for road traffic deaths per capita. IMO it doesn't feel that crazy, and [[Chiang Mai]] is safer than [[Bangkok]], but for sure you are more likely to die on the roads here than in your home country. 80% of these deaths are motorbike-related so you can mitigate this risk by using cars as much as possible, Grab Taxi will take you to most places for €3-€5. And wear a proper helmet at all times on a bike! 
2. **Air pollution.** February to May each year is smokey season and it gets particularly bad in Chiang Mai, in 2021 it spent a few days as the world's most air polluted city. The length of time and level of pollution changes from year to year. Advisable to leave Chiang Mai, or invest in air purifiers.

Other than that there aren't many cons for me personally. I love the style of living here. Some might not :) 


**Pros:**
1. Low cost of living. Even better if you work remotely for a Western wage.
2. Beautiful weather, nature, cities, temples, etc
3. Delicious and cheap food
4. Beautiful women
5. More of a laid-back lifestyle. They care less for health and safety here so life is a little more 'free' ([[Western life is wrapped in bubble wrap]])
6. Lots to see and do
7. Easy to stay here long-term, looser visa situation compared to many countries



My personal take on it is that it's a fantastic place for young people (18 to 28 maybe, though all ages can enjoy it here) to spend a while in if they can work from their laptop. 


## Parts of Thailand
I won't go deep on this for now as you can find regions you like online.
Bangkok is cool to see for a week or two IMO, and I live in[[ Chiang Mai]] so I'm biased towards it but I love it for a lot of practical reasons too.
