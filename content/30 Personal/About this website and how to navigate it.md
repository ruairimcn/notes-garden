I write and manage my notes ([[Tend to your notes like a gardener]]) using a service called [[Obsidian]].

Obsidian is free, but they offer a paid monthly service called [[Obsidian Publish]] which lets me easily publish my notes to a simple but powerful website.  

Having my own custom domain (ruairimcnicholas.com) and managing my domain on [[Cloudflare]].

Put all that together and you have this website! It is very easy to use, allowing me to focus on making, connecting, and tending to my notes.

It is like a **personal Wikipedia**, written for me, by me, but also with the goal of making this information useful to people who share my interests and principles.

The way in which I write, structure, organise, tag, and connect these notes falls under the domain of [[Knowledge Management]]
