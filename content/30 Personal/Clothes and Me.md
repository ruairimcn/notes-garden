# Clothes and Me
I own very little clothes. This is mostly due to 
- not having much interest in fashion
- practical reasons; I have lived abroad for 17 months and I [[Travel light]]
- practicing [[Minimalism]]


As a result I own very little clothes, when I moved to Thailand to live here in 2021 I brought
- 2 pairs of shorts
- 4 tshirts
- 3 pairs of socks
- 3 pairs of underwear
- 1 pair of travel shoes 


I have bought some more of each of the above items now that I am renting a house in [[Thailand]] for the long-term.

I also own one suit as [[The Suit]] is the one area of fashion that I'm interested in.
