This is the principle and practice of working on a new project/endeavor in public view, such that anyone can see it in its current state and render judgement. 

I have decided to practice this because I feel I've spent too long waiting to get my knowledge out there to the world on topics that I'm well versed in, namely meditation and web design freelancing. 
I also have read [[Principles]] by [[Ray Dalio]] and he makes an excellent case for [[Practicing Radical Honesty and Transparency]], I find his argument compelling so I'm puttting it into practice.

I learned about this idea from  from Andy Matuschak on his excellent website about [[Evergreen Notes]] -  https://notes.andymatuschak.org/
