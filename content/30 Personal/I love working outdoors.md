# I love working outdoors
The title says it all!
First, check out my [[Outdoor Office]].

After returning from my [[May 2021 Pa Pae Meditation Retreat|First meditation retreat]] which was in a very scenic tropical forest, I moved my desk outside to my porch.

2 weeks later, I shudder at the thought of ever going back to working indoors. My home office is fine, there's no problems with it, except that now, after working outside, it very much feels 'boxed in'. I've come to feel that walls are bad for our mental health and general feeling of wellbeing, a part of [[The Modern Problem MoC]] as our hunter-gatherer ancestors spent their days out in nature for hundreds of thousands of years. 

[According to the National Health Service in the UK](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/short-sightedness/causes/),
'Research has found that spending time playing outside as a child may reduce your chances of becoming short-sighted, and existing short-sightedness may progress less quickly.'

Out in nature, everything looks better, smells better, sounds better, and is much more in tune with our hunter-gatherer past. 

I will be doing my best in later years of life to be able to continue to work outside, and if I do need to work inside I'll be filling that indoor room with as many indoor plants as I can comfortably fit!
