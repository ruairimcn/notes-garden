# Born to Age 12
I was born Ruair√≠ McNicholas on 11th December 1996 in University Hospital Galway. Now the eldest of four children, I lived a happy childhood in Knocknacrra, Galway, until we moved to Donaghpatrick, Headford, to make room for a family of 3 to become a family of 6.

Computers were always in our house. Dad, a musician and guitar teacher, was an Apple Mac fan, and I can remember playing very basic late 1990's games and early 2000's on these:

Coincidentally, when we lived in Donaghpatrick I attended [[Kilcoona National School]] and we were very lucky to always have Mac computers in the school.

So I knew my way around a computer from a young age.


# 12 to 16: iWeb

Along came the mighty iMac G5, with a suite of creative software included in the iLife suite ([Wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILife)):
- Garageband
- iMovie
- iPhoto
- [[iWeb]]
- iDVD


I tried out these different apps over the years, and iWeb captured my interest more and more. Althought I didn't know it at the time, I had a deep interest in [[Effective communication]], and I enjoyed setting up websites such as
- A website for our local Cubs and Scouts group to give info on meetup times and mother important info
- Online forums for different gaming clans I was invovled with

As the years went by, around age 16 I partnered up with a friend from school who was also interested in IT and the internet, to sell basic websites. We started off with [[Drupal]] and eventually moved on to [[WordPress]].
