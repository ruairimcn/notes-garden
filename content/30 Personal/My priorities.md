# üèî My priorities
## Introduction
I believe it is very important for one to develop a list of their top priorities.
We all have a limited amount of time on this planet, yet we have such a large number of possible things to do that it may as well be unlimited as we can't do it all.

Furthermore, the [[Infomation Age]] has also become **The Age of Distraction**, and the [[Attention economy]] has given rise to thousands of apps, websites, and media outlets that are competing for [[Our two most important resources - time and attention]]. These things make it difficult to give time and attention to what matters most - our **priorities.**

Creating a well-thought-out list of priorities can help us with this - when we have a list of our priorities we can turn to it when we are in doubt as to how we should be spending our time and attention. 

For coming up with your own priorities see [[Working out your priorities]].



# My 2021 Priorities
The below is a visual representation of my priorities that I use as my laptop and tablet wallpaper.

## Momentum Mind Academy
This is a business I an part of, it encompasses all of my work priorities, as come September 2021 the sole focus of my professional work will be this business.

This is also a way of life: The core purpose of the business is developing and deploying a self-improvement course called Momentum Mind, and following it includes getting better sleep, more exercise, and improving one's reading and study.

So this principle encompasses both **working** in and on the businesses, and **living** its teachings.

By acting on this principle I
- Make more money
- Grow my professional network. Meet new and exiting people
- Get to try and overcome new challenges
- Develop new skills and ideas
- Help others 


## Friends and family
This encompasses
- Spending time with my partner and helping her to grow and have fun
- Keeping in contact with close family and supporting them
- Keeping in contact with close friends and supporting them
- Wholesome social activities such as exploring nature, camping, and playing board games
- In time it will come to include my own family of children, until then it includes researching [[Parenting]].


## Meditation & Dharma
This covers
- Practicing meditation daily, improving my practice via experience and reading 
- Practicing and training in [[The Three Trainings]] from [[Buddhism]]
- Discussing these two areas with other interested people 


## Reading and Writing
This covers
- Any kind of writing, currently this means writing in Obsidian for study, research, as well as writing blog-like notes for others to read
- Any reading, studying, or note-taking on material I am interested in. Sometimes the material will be related to these priorities, sometimes it will be [[My interests]].


## The Human Dance
The name here comes from [[Alan Watts]] who sometimes describes life as a dance.
This priority encompasses things that make ice exciting and enjoyable that don't fit into my other four priorities - life would get dull if I only spent my time on these four priorities.

It includes things like
- Listening to and playing music
- Spending time on [[My interests]] (ones outside of my priorites)
- Occasionally partying with friends
- Video games and board games
- Exploring nature and the world in general 
- Doing nothing. Being bored. Relaxing.
