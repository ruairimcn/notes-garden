## Intro
- I went into this experience with an open mind and a great sense of excitement and adventute.
- This was my first meditation retreat.
- I have been meditating on and off for about two and a half years.
- I brought no electronic devices with me except a digital watch and a battery-powered alarm clock. 
- I brought very few items - toiletries aside the main ones were a small notebook, two pens, and my physical copy of the book [[The Mind Illuminated]].
- This was not a silent retreat, though I did a great deal less talking than I do in normal life.

## The Retreat Center
### Pa Pae Village
Pa Pae is a very small village, nested away in a small mountainous valley in North Western Thailand. The retreat center is very much a part of the village and there isn't much of a line where one ends and one begins; locals often come through the retreat area as they have rice fields and fruit/veg farms scattered throghout the retreat area.

The area of Pa Pae that the retreat center is in had maybe 20 or so buildings total and I'd guess maybe 100 people lives in the immediate area. There were only two small unbranded family-run stores. There were no modern gas pumps, instead they had old-style oil barrels. I didn't have any electronic devices with me to take a photo but here is a photo from Google of the same set-up:

That should give you an idea of how rural the area was. This was a great contributor to the relaxed and laid-back experience of the whole retreat.


### The Retreat Center
The center itself is maybe best described as half Buddhist temple, half retreat center. 
There were about 20 monks living full time here, each with their own small bamboo hut. 15 or so were from Thailand and surrounding countries. Two were from Australia, one from America, and one from Kenya who thinks he might be the first and only Kenyan Buddhist Monk!

There were a few Thai volunteers on site at all times, some lived there and some came each day. The level of support that the Thais gave the center was very impressive and humbling, from cleaning rooms and clothes, to cooking delicious meals each day.

And then there was anywhere from 3 to 6 retreat participants there at a time, all free to come and go as we pleased.

The different living quarters, canteens, and meditation halls were scattered across a forest hill directly in the village - nature was every and intimate at all times. 

#### Meditation Halls

**Center Hall:** Morning and evening meditation and chanting. One of the more 'modern' buildings that will likely last decades. Electricity, fans, and bug nets over all windows. Closed air but with large windows and doors

**Moon Hall:** Open-air wood and bamboo structure - the monks told me a bamboo structure usually lasts about 5 years, the fact that they build structures that will last only a few years is, I think, a good show of their living in harmony with [[Impermanence]].
We often had a 30 minute walking meditation here, followed by 30 minutes sitting. It has beautiful views of the valley & mountains, and is right beside a walking meditation track that has water pools in the middle. Very beautiful.

**River Hall:** Small, basic, open-air bamboo hall  beside a river, very scenic.

**Vimutti Hall and Treehouse:** Small, basic, open-air bamboo hall beside a water reservoir. A basic but beautiful wooden and bamboo treehouse is right beside it. 


### Daily Schedule:
6:00am: Morning meditation and chanting at Center Hall. I went to this a handful of times. I meditate while they chant in [[Pali]].

6:30am: Alms round. The monks split up and walk barefoot around the village. Villagers will be waiting at the front of their homes (some of them, not all of them). They place various items into the monk's alms bowls (a large metal bowl with a lid and a strap for carrying), typically
- Thai food in plastic bags
- Rice in bags
- Bottles of water
- Various cartons with soy milk, fruit juice, etc
- Snacks like biscuits and crisps

Once this is done, the villager kneels and makes the Wai (hands together in prayer style), and the monks deliver a blessing for good health and fortune. They repeat this around the village and return to the canteen between 7am and 7:30am. Two large metal plates are put down, one for all the rice and one for all the bags of food. Snacks, water, and drinks go on shelves.

7:30am: Breakfast.
The participants and volunteers kneel around the main food table while the monks give a short blessing. We then sit at one table while the monks choose their food and sit at another. They can choose from the day's alms round food, as well as whatever the volunteers have cooked this morning which varied from fruit and veg salads, to hot Thai meals.
They say another blessing, and we all then silently meditate for about a minute, to reflect on the food before us, how we're lucky to have it, etc.
The participants and volunteers can then take their food.

10am: Meditation session.
There was usually a meditation session at this time for retreat participants , usually a 30 minute sit, or a 30 minute [[Walking Meditation]] followed by 30 minutes sitting. They were usually run by a foreign English-speaking monk but sometimes by an English-speaking Thai monk. Afterwards, we're able to share our experience if we want and ask questions. I found all of the monks to be a great source of simple but profound wisdom, on topics from meditation to life in general.

11:30am: Lunch.
Same deal as breakfast. The monks won't eat after this time, although they can have fruit and soy drinks throughout the day.

3:00am: Meditation session.
Same deal as 10am meditation session.

6:30am:
Same deal as morning chanting and meditation, though there are typically more monks and participants present at this one.


And that is the general schedule. Some days there were other items, such as volunteer work: one time we went bushwhacking; clearing a path through the jungle. Monks and us retreat participants went out to a  completely overgrown path to an ancient Buddhist temple. With axes, machetes, rakes, and shovels, we cleared a path. It was a tiring but amazing experience, one I was not expecting at all but very glad to get a chance to do. Monks don't just sit around all day, that's for sure, and they are well able to use a machete!!

Retreat participants are pretty much free to do what we want with regards to the schedule, but we're encouraged to follow it. 


### Mae Good - Living off the Grid
A few days into the retreat, I began to hear of an American Monk, Luang Phi Michele, who lived 'off the grid' in a place called Mae Good.

> Luang Phi (pronounced Lumpi) is the title we used to address monks: 'Luang Phi Paul, Luang Phi Michael, etc'

Another monk was moving to here for a week, and I traveled there to see what the area was like.

It was an amazing spot.
- There was just about running water. Cold showers only!
- There was no electricity except for a few solar panels for lighting and charging devices
- There was no phone signal (I had no phone with me anyways)
- There were just four open-wall bamboo halls there; one for sleeping, one for eating, one for cooking, and one for meditating and chanting in.
- It was a 30 minute walk from the nearest village.

I stayed here for 2 nights, sleeping in a mosquito net on the ground, with a blanket and a sleeping bag. It was even more quiet and relaxed than the meditation center. A retreat participant and a Thai engineer helping to build two bamboo huts here for the Monks, also came with, for a total of 5. So my options for activities were
- Talking
- Helping build the bamboo huts
- Meditate
- Read [[The Mind Illuminated]]
- Explore nature

The monks walked 30 minutes to the village, 30 minutes around it on their [[Alms Round]], and 30 minutes back every morning starting at 6am. I went both times, the first time bare foot and the second time carrying an empty 20 liter bottle of water to fill up. The water filtering/vending machine in the village wasn't working, so the villagers showed me the local well! Literally a hole in the ground down to a stream, with a bucket attached to a rope that you throw down, fill up, and pull back up. I'd never seen or used a well before so that was an interesting and memorable experience.



### My overall experience
Everything mentioned above made the experience very laid back, relaxing and calm.
I can best put it this way: At home in my normal live, **I need to know what day it is.** I have personal and work commitments that mean I need to schedule my time on a calendar.
But on the retreat, **I did not need to know what day it was.** I just checked the white board at breakfast each morning to see the plan for the day.
This allowed me to 'shift down a gear' in the 'speed' of my live to a level it has never been down at before. There was really no need to think about the past or the future, and this allowed me to live in the moment in a way I have never done for very long - on a calm weekend I might have a few hours of this, but here this lasted for days. This was both very relaxing and peaceful in itself, and also made for the ideal meditation environment as thoughts about the past and future arose in my mind less given this environment. 

This was
- The longest I have ever been off from work since I started freelancing 5 years ago
- The longest I've gotten up so early in the morning regularly
- The longest I've been without internet or smart devices
- The most meditation I've done in a 10 day window before

I found myself eating slower (a big change for me, I eat too fast usually), walking slower, talking slower - almost every area of my life slowed down. The experience was a fantastic 'battery recharger'.

It is one of the best experience I have had, and it is interesting to reflect on how my definition of an 'amazing experience' has changed throughout my life - I likely wouldn't have wanted to do this as a child, teenager, or young adult (I'm 25 at time of writing), as I preferred gaming and partying a lot more back then!




## My Meditation Experience
#WorkInProgress 

The particular 'style' of meditation I practice is [[Samatha Vipassana Meditation]] as taught by [[Culadasa]] in his excellent book [[The Mind Illuminated]].

To give you a basic overview:

### The Mind Illuminated Overview
The book gives the reader 10 stages to work to, where, upon Stage 10 mastery, one can abide in the state of [[Samatha]]. By this stage one has often had a full or partial awakening experience.

**Stage 1:** Meditate every single day.

**Stage 2:** When you meditate on an object (typically the sensations of breathing), you quickly forget that you were meant to be focusing on the object, and your mind starts wandering through chains of thoughts. Eventually you have the 'Aha!' moment of realisng you were meant to be focusing on the breath. You congratulate yourself for doing this and build the habit of catching your mind wandering. You master it when you can sustain attention on your chosen object for minutes and mind wandering only lasts seconds.

**Stage 3:** You label distractions ('Thought about food. Thought about gaming. Thought about scratching that itch') and check in on your state of mind to catch distractions before they cause forgetting. Mastery of this stage means you rarely ever forget the meditation object.

**Stage 4:** You tighten up your attention and broaden your awareness to catch subtle distractions before they become gross distractions (short time thinking about distraction = subtle, long time thinking about it = gross). But looking inwards to the mind like this has been associated with sleep for most of our lives so we also have to combat drowsiness.

Stage 5 and 6 get you [[Single Pointed Attention]] where distractions stop arising. Stage 7 works on making this process effortless, and Stages 8-10 work on pacifying your physical senses and unifying your mind to get it into Samatha.




### My Progress
Firstly, I hadn't mastered Stage 1 before this retreat as I have missed plenty of days since I first began practicing meditation according to [[The Mind Illuminated]]. I'm confident I won't be missing any days following this retreat but we'll see!

I have been working on Stage 3 for the last year. I've had a handful of 30 minute sessions where I didn't forget my breath, maybe only 5 total.

Midway into the retreat, day 5 of 10, I had largely overcome (but not mastered) Stage 3: Some sessions I didn't forget the breath, some I did but only 1-2 times and very briefly. I began working on Stage 4 and even a little of Stage 5, which I had never done before.

I usually get feelings of happiness, joy, contentment, and compassion while meditating, I feel this increased on the retreat slightly, probably owing to the progress and to the beautiful setup of the retreat. I found myself smiling more when I was sitting down to meditate.

So in summmary this was 
- The furthest I'd ever gotten in the meditation practice set out in The Mind Illuminated
- The most progressive I've made in a 10 day period before.

I've often read that retreats are great for making faster progress, and I've now experienced this for myself.

I intend on doing these kinds of meditation retreats several times a year now!

#### Noticing mind-wandering in daily life
I began to start noticing, while not meditating, when I was lost in thought. I'd notice that I was lost in some fantasy or plan about the future, or reliving or recalling some part of the past, at the cost of paying less attention to what I was doing in the present. 

This would very rarely happen previously outside of retreats, but it was now happening several times a day during the retreat.

[[The Mind Illuminated]] says that a key goal is to start integrating formal meditation into daily life so I'm excited to see this happening more and more in my own life!


## Recharging my Batteries
This retreat was the longest break I have had from work since I started freelancing about 5 years ago. I have gone on holidays with family and friends in those 5 years, but have had to spend at least some amount of time taking care of work while gone. 

As such it was a fantastic way to step back from work life and properly 'recharge my batteries'. Had I my phone with me, my minor email addiction would likely have meant I'd have checked my emails at least a handful of times while on the retreat. Having no electronic devices let me cut out this possibility entirely.

Time off work like this enhances both one's personal and professional life, allowing for new ideas and perspectives on both to arise. I recommend a break like to everyone, but especially to those who have found it difficult to take a stretch of time away from work completely.

Thanks is due to my four web design team members in [[Propeller Digital]] who held down the fort while I was gone!


## Writings

^af713f

I had a small notebook with me and did some light writing in it, some of which is shown below.

### What Spirituality is to me
Spirituality, to me, is:
- More selflessness, less selfishness.
- More compassion, less hate.
- More peace, less anger.
- More truth, less dogma.
- More awareness, less unconscious action.
- More giving, less greed,
- More questions, less answers.
- More inner looking, less outer seeking.
- More minimalism, less materialism. 
- More inner joy, less outer happiness.
- More present, in the now, less in the past or future.


### The Maze of Thoughts and Ideas
When we are first born, our mind is pure. But society pulls us through a Maze of Thoughts and Ideas - a process that is beneficial to society but causes us suffering individually.

[[Buddha]] discovered a way ourt of the maze by tracing his footsteps back out of it. By following his teachings, we can do this too.

(You can start off with his teachings by checking out
[[Training in Morality]]
[[Training in Concentration]]
[[Training in Wisdom]])



## Other Thoughts from the Retreat

### Meditation Microscope Analogy
The monks on the retreat often compared meditators to scientists running an experiment - they encouraged us to probe our experience, examine it, try different techniques, use different meditation objects, adjust our posture, etc.

This let to me working on the [[Meditation Microscope Analogy]]



### Inverting Maslow's Hierarchy
The Head Monk of the retreat (a very wise Thai man and a qualified medical doctor) did a meditation session with us, and passed on a lot of wisdom and knowledge afterwards.
One thing he said is that "Monks invert [[Ascending Maslow's Hierarchy]] ". i.e. the shape of the hierarchy/pyramid is reversed. So instead of physical needs being the biggest level at the bottom and [[Self-actualisation]] being the smallest level at the top (and hence most people spending the least time here, if any), for Monks they spend the bare minimum time worrying about physical needs in order to spend the most time achieving Self-actualisation.

I really like this idea!
