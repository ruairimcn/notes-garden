I recently switched to using a different search engine, [[Ecosia]].
After over a decade using Google, I decided I would either change to Duck Duck Go or Ecosia.

# Why?
To avoid the [[Echo bubble effect]].
It's not privacy that concerns me to be honest - it's the fact that two people in different parts of the world will get different search results in Google. They are tailored to the profile Google has built on us. This can be advantageous in the form of more useful search results, but it also means
- We aren't exposed to opposing ideas so we challenge our existing ideas less, and some of them are likely wrong


# Ecosia VS Duck Duck Go
Both seem simialr based on the brief research I did, but Ecosia exists to plant trees. Their ad profits are used to pay underprivilleged people to plant trees, so they are generating employment while also helping the environment.
