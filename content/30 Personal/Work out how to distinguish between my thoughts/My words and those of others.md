I have often read that it is best for notes in Obsidian/one's knowledge base to be ones own words and not the words of, say, authors ones books you are studying.

However I'm not sure I should or can paraphrase everything in the books I study.

For now I will distinguish whole sentences or paragraphs by the author by prefacing it with 'AUTHOR NAME says' for paraphrasing and with '' quotes for direct quotes.
