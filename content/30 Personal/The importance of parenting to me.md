# The importance of parenting to me
For me, the importance of parenting is visible in every single aspect of my life.
As I think it is for others too, as [[Psychology]] tells us that what happens in our childhood will largely effect the rest of our lives.

As such, parenting has a huge effect on the quality of a person's life. 

## My childhood
I am extremely lucky/fortunate/blessed/privileged to have had what was, by all accounts, an excellent childhood. 
This is due to
- The place I was born; quiet and safe [[Ireland]].
- The time I was born in; 1996, the [[Information Age]], the most peaceful time in human history, and one of unprecedented prosperity.
- The parents I was born to.

The first two are somewhat 'passive'; once I was born in a particular place and time, that was that. 
Parenting, on the other hand, involved 24 years (and counting) of pretty much continuous love, support, time, energy, and money. 24 years because that's how old I am now; I suspect my parents shall be excellent parents right up to their last moments.

Without hesitation, I'd award my parents an A+ if this was one big parenting exam. 
Instead of pushing me down the path that **they** wanted for me, they gave me the emotional and mental tools needed to pursue the path that **I** wanted for myself. 

I genuinely couldn't ask for better parents.

## Passing on the torch
Due to the positive impact that excellent parenting has had on my life, and the deep gratitude I feel as a result of this, I feel a deep desire to pass this on to my own children, and in the long term, to continue what will hopefully be a line of great parenting and family creating that stretches deep into the future.


# The family as the most important unit in society
I think that the family is one of the most, **if not the most**, important 'unit' in society, other units being the individual, larger communities, nations, businesses, etc.

Hence, I think starting and maintaining a family with a net positive effect is one of the best things one can do for him/herself, their family, wider community, nation, and the planet.
