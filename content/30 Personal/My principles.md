# Intro

A book that has had a significant positive impact on my life is [[Principles]] by [[Ray Dalio]].

Dalio is a billionaire investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. In Principles, he discusses the importance of writing down one’s principles that they live life by, as well as sharing his own.

He tells us that
***Being clear on your principles is most important because they will affect all aspects of your life, many times a day.** In any relationship, your principles and the other persons will interact. Having shared principles leads to the best relationships, when they’re not shared misunderstandings and conflicts happen.*

I agree with this, and it has inspired me to share my own principles below. This list will be updated as I take on new principles that I want to live my life by.
