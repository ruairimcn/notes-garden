## History
In 2019, I was living in Thailand and earning all my cash from [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]]. I had teamed up 50/50 on the business with my mate Oliver who had been living in Thailand already. At the time I was working under the business name 'RM Creative'. These are my initials and we also felt we could do better and make a better brand, so after much brainstorming, we chose Propeller Digital, and Oliver and I co-founded what would soon become a [[Freelance Collective]].


## Becoming a Freelance Collective
Oliver and I worked together for about a year, growing our income and clients month by month. We then took on a friend of mine who I had worked with before, Paddy. At this point we became a Freelance Collective, as it was more of a 50/50 partnership when it was just two of us. A few months later and we brought two more web designers on board, Sean and Dylan. We have kept it at five for the last year or so.
