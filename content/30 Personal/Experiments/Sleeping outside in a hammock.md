**Date:** 26th June 2021
This note will document an experiment I am undertaking: sleeping outside in a [[Hammocks|Hammock]] for a week, and then deciding on whether to not it will be a permanent change. 

Recently I have been learning more about [[The Modern Problem MoC]] - how moving away from our hunter-gatherer lifestyle and towards the modern lifestyle is generally detrimental to our health.

I learned that **the more time we spend outdoors in nature, the better.** My thinking was that this likely applied to where we sleep too, especially since I had learned that [[Morning sunlight wakes us up faster than afternoon sunlight]].

I purchased a simple hammock online that has a built-in mosquito net to keep mosquitos and other bugs from biting me. Here's a photo of my setup (there are actually two hammocks in the photo, one general purpose one without a net, and one for sleeping with a net):

# Night 1:
**Night of:** Friday 25th June

I put together some sleeping items into a plastic bag, which I kept inside the hammock:
- Earplugs. Sometimes the traffic outside can be loud, and our water tank is very loud, so earplugs help me to sleep outside.
- Eye mask. There is a bright streetlight nearby, and the moon is quite bright too! Helps me to sleep.
- Surgical tape to keep my mouth shut at night - [[Close your mouth with tape at night for better sleep]].
- Keys, to get inside in the morning. 

I also kept a bottle of water outside the hammock on the ground (the hammock is close to the ground so I can get it easily).

## Summary
I got a poor night's sleep! I was expecting that as it will take some time to adapt to, but somethings occurred that reduced my sleep quality which I can rectify for tonight:
- **I needed a fan for the first half of the night.** It was hotter than I was expecting. The bug net is very tight/the holes are small, when I opened it briefly it became cooler so I think it keeps the heat in. Luckily the spot my hammock is in is (mostly) sheltered from the rain and has one electricity plug so an hour in I put a fan down. This was fine except it got a little too cold in the middle of the night; the fan has an hourly timer so tonight I'll turn on the fan for the fist 4 hours only.
- **I should clean my feet before getting in to the hammock.** Any grit and dirt on my feet will eventually rub off the hammock and pool at the middle since it hangs down, where it was itching my body. The solution is to give my feet a light clean with a mat, brush, or even just my hand to get off any loose and hard dirt.
- **Experiment with ways of lying down.** Lying slightly sideways/diagonally seems to be the best way to sleep in the hammock. There are many different ways to lie and sleep so I will experiment to find the best one.

I think a few nights of practicing the above and getting accustomed to the new way of sleeping will turn this into a much better way of sleeping. Let's see how tonight's sleep goes. 

# Night 2
**Night of:** Saturday 26th June
I slept outside for half the night and inside for the other half as I was finding it hard to get to sleep. But I don't think this was due to the hammock; I made the changes from yesterday and found it quite comfortable, but sleep evaded me. I also wanted to cuddle my girlfriend :)

I'll try again tomorrow night and will do an 8th night in the experiment to make up for the half night.


# Night 3
**Night of:** Sunday 27th June
All went well until about 4am; half awake half asleep, I woke up feeling 'off' and stumbled up to bed.

In the morning, feeling fine and not noticing anything wrong, my girlfriend exlaimed 'What happened to your leg!?'. Looking down I saw my leg was covered with mosquito bites! 30 at least, and maybe 20 on my other leg.
Interestingly, I didn't notice these whatsoever, and might not have had she not pointed them out. I can't feel them at all but I think this caused me to feel 'off' during the night.

Strangely I didn't notice this whatsoever at night or when I woke up.

I try to lay down with my legs up towards the end of the hammock, however this puts my legs up against the mosquito net and it seems that, even though the holes in the net are **very small**, mosquitos can fit their little blood straws through it!

**Possible solutions:**
1) Keep my legs away from the net. Probably not going to work as I move around during the night.
2) Spray the net and hammock with mosquito spray. I don't like aerosols so I wouldn't be up for doing this every evening.
3) Get an outer net that goes around the hammock. It's another thing to set up and buy but I think I will go this route. 


# Night 4
**Night of:** Monday 28th June
Before spending money on new equipment, I tried using these guy lines at the side of the hammock to pull out the sides more, making a bit more space inside the hammock to keep my legs away from the netting, as evidently if they're pressed against it the mosquitos can get to my tasty blood.

However, when showering before bed **I spotted mosquito bites on my back, and the undersides of my arms!** It's not just the netting, the wee bloodsuckers are getting me through the underside of the hammock too!

I tried lying down on top of a blanket inside the hammock but it moves out from underneath me so I didn't think it would work and I slept inside.

I've placed an order online for a 'mosquito hammock net', a much larger net that my hammock can fit inside. I will wait for this to arrive before resuming this experiment!
