# The Problem
Over the last few years I have begun to suspect that my use of the internet has had several negative effects on me; namely that it has decreased my ability to focus for long periods of time, and has increased my cravings for [[Instant gratification|instant gratification]]. For more on how and why this happens you can check out the excellent book [[The Shallows]].

My ability to focus hasn't been ruined entirely - I would guess that I read more books than most people my age - but it has definitely hindered it. I want to rebuild this skill and reclaim more time each day that is lost to unproductive and unfulfilling internet usage.


# A Possible Solution
I have already taken steps to address this problem:
- I have blocked the most common distracting websites that I visit on all my digital devices, though I do turn this block off at times. 
- I have deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts, I only use Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Linkedin, and I probably have a combined usage of them that was less than Facebook and Instagram. 
- In general I try to minimize time wasted online.

Recently I have been experimenting with using internet access as a 'Distraction kill switch', by turning it off if I'm, say, 20 minutes into watching silly YouTube clips. This has helped but I want to take this further:

I will keep the [[Internet off by default]] on my devices.
You can click the link above to learn about the specifics, the gist is that I have to write down what I will turn the internet on to do, and for how long, before I turn it on.

Below I will keep a journal about how this experiment is going.

## Thursday 9th September
Day 1 begins!

I have downloaded offline content onto my devices, mostly Kindle books and Spotify songs, so that I can access them without the internet.

My two main devices are a Macbook Pro and iPad Air, and I have a Pixel 3 phone.
My 4G package for my phone recently expired; I am going to experiment with not renewing this. [[Chiang Mai]] has plenty of cafes and co-working spaces with wifi.

I started off the morning by checking out the Obsidian Discord channel, before remembering that I was thinking of doing this experiment; I turned off the internet, and opened up Obsidian to plan out this experiment and begin it.

It's 08:14 now, I reckon I can keep the internet off until after I eat and come back to my desk at a local co-working space; that would be around 1:30pm; that's 5 hours and 15 minutes.

Thankfully, I recently changed career and my new role allows me to stay offline for large amounts of time. I had been working as a freelance web designer for about 5 years, and this work required a lot of regular internet access, mainly to communicate with clients and colleagues, and to work on websites as I kept work-in-progress websites online as opposed to offline.

My new role is in a business called Momentum Mind; it's an e-learning/e-training business, and my main task at the moment is investigating [[The Technology-Productivity Link and Decline]]. So I can set aside the morning to look further into this topic, and my primary source of material at the moment is the book [[The Shallows]] which I will read on the Kindle app on my iPad. 

Let's see how this plan goes! 


### 12:53pm
Success! It's 12:53pm and I haven't turned on the internet. I'm back from a big lunch and feeling low on energy as my stomach gets to work; I have a few online tasks to do that don't  require much brain power so I'llÂ 
- switch on my internet on my iPad to publish a few notes from Obsidian, including this one. That means strictly no other internet use.
- Turn on the internet on my laptop to do two web design tasks, then do a quick email and Basecamp check. One hour max.

**One hour later...** 
That went **very** well. I had everything done plus a little more within the hour. It was very focused; attention was strong and I didn't break it to change task or to distract myself with something online. I'd give that about a 9/10 focus score. 


### 1:30pm onwards
My internet usage went up for the rest of the day as I had to communicate with work colleagues. I didn't plan out how to use the time like I did earlier, but I still try to minimize usage and I mostly turned off WiFi when I wasn't using it


### Going into tomorrow
I will aim to not use the internet until after lunch tomorrow. I can improve on today by not briefly using it in the early morning shortly after rising, and trying to limit my usage later into the day and evening. 



## Friday 10th September
Usually I do a quick internet check-in shortly before waking up (news, Discord, email); not today! 
I did turn it on briefly to look how best to clean rock climbing shoes, but
- I managed to only do this, then turned the internet off.
- I had been meaning to do this for nearly two weeks and didn't get around to it, possibly because I was getting distracted by rubbish on the internet each morning!

9:28am now, I'll get in 3-4 internet-free hours now to read [[The Shallows]]

--- 


### In the office
I rent a desk in a co-working space, having arrived in this morning my mind is throwing up some things I want to use the internet for; I'm going to keep a small notebook open on my desk to jot down such thoughts, to do them when I turn the internet on. 


### 1:00pm
Made it to 1:00pm again, just after I finished eating. Did a quick check of email and messaging apps; only took a few minutes, a benefit of having used less and less social media and email over the last few years is that I get less messages and emails, so checking them takes less time.

I kept the internet on from about 1:45pm to 2:45pm, that's all my online work done for the day so I can turn it off for the rest of the day.



## Weekend
I found that this habit leaked into my weekend somewhat, as I reckon I was connected to the internet a lot less than I usually am. I was more conscious of my internet use whenever I took my phone out, and once this happened I tried to stop using it as soon as possible.


# Results, Going forward
This practice has let me read a lot more material (mainly the book about internet usage [[The Shallows]]) than I generally would in a week and has helped me to see that many areas of my life can benefit from taking longer and more frequent breaks from the internet.

So here's what I'll be doing going forward:
1. I will be turning off the internet on my devices once I finish work, and will keep it turned off throughout the evening and night.
2. I won't be turning the internet back on until around 1pm the following day, after I have eaten.
3. From there I will try to batch together all my tasks that require the internet, including taking online material offline for later consumption. 
4. Rinse and repeat.

This will be the norm; sometimes exceptions will arise and I will deem the internet worth turning on. However, when I do so, I will turn it on and aim to turn it off again as quickly as possible, only doing the task that I set out to do. Sometimes I'll write down what I'm going to do to help me stick to it, sometimes I'll dive in and trust in my willpower! t off now and dive back into [[The Shallows]]!
