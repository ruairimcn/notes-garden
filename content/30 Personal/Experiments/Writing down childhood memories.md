This was inspired by a friend and work colleague, Oliver.
I write down memories from my childhood whenever they pop into my head, and sometimes I'll sit down specifically to write them in order to try and prompt them to arise.

This is mainly for nostalgic purposes as it's nice to recall my childhood sometimes,  and I'd imagine these memories will get harder to recall as I grow older.
