The [Shell Backpack by Tropicfeel](https://www.tropicfeel.com/pages/shell-backpack) is a bag I have owned for about 3 months since this note was created.

It is an excellent bag that I love and use regularly.

## Folding Wardobe
This is an optional extra.
It is a black 'bag' that you can hang inside your wardrobe, with 3 different sections for storing various items of clothing.
As I don't own much clothes anyways, most of my clothes fits in here so I use it at home even when not traveling. 

When it comes time to travel somewhere for a few days, I
- Make sure the clothes I want to bring is inside
- Take it out of the wardrobe
- Pull the straps at the side tight to compress it down
- Pop it into the main backpack

It takes up about half of my bag when inside, though it you have a lot of clothes you can pack it enough to fill the entire bag.
When I reach my destination I take it out, untighten the straps, and hang it up.
Nice and easy!

# Personal Use
Thanks to my minimal lifestyle (particularly clothes) and my work being digital and remote, I can leave home and live somewhere else with just this backpack.

Below is a photo of the bag strapped to the back of my bike, with a waterproof cover. I drove 3 hours from [[Chiang Mai]] to [[Pai]] in [[Thailand]] and stayed at a countryside hotel for 5 nights with just this bag and the clothes I was wearing.

## What's with the red tape?
You can see a piece of red tape on the outside of my bag.
I still don't know what caused this - somehow I placed my bag up against something so hot that it melted a hole straight through the bag. I'm impressed that the hole wasn't bigger, that the whole thing didn't go up in flames, and that the hole's edges kind of 'self-sealed' and didn't get bigger from general use after.
I put tape on the inside and outside and sewed it on to keep it from coming off and to help keep the bag water-resistant.
