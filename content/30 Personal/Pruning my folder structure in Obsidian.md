I am reaching a point in [[Obsidian]] where folders are starting to create friction: **I am finding that I have more and more notes that straddle multiple categories and are hard to fit into one folder.**

So, I'm going to experiment with pruning my folder structure.
E.g. I have the folder "Concepts" with many subfolders, from Anthropology and Neurology to Yoga and Drumming. I will prune this down to 'Concepts' and put all notes from sub-folders in there.

# Result
I went through each folder in Concepts and removed each note after I gave it a categorising tag, usually a "Concept/" one.

**19th Oct 2021**
I have gotten rid of all folders except for
- Cognitive Biases
- Logical Fallacies
- Mental Models

As I feel that these are clear-cut categories. But I might remove them in the future.
I also haven't removed the folders for
- Freelancing and Work
- Knowledge Manangement
- Meditation & Buddhism
As these are probably my three largest folders by volume and I haven't gotten around to going through and tagging each note yet.
