# What is a Map of Content?
A Map of Content is a note that links to other related note.
It's a 'starting point' for learning more about a particular concept/idea/skill.

They are a valuble tool in [[Knowledge Management]] and when using [[The Slip-box]].
The general advice I've seen on them is to not worry about them when you first start using a [[Knowledge Management]] tool like [[Obsidian]], and to instead create them once you have a lot of notes in one area and are struggling to keep them together, find the ones you want, etc any other stress/anxiety caused by your growing note library.
