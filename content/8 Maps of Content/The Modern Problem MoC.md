The Modern Problem is the problem of human beings having hunter-gather brains and bodies, which comes into conflict with the modern world of the 21st century; Modern life and society change very quickly due to technology, quicker than the human body and mind can change and adapt.
**These changes are usually not suited to our bodies and minds, and this create physical and mental problems for us.**

This is a #WorkInProgress and I intend to give more useful solutions to the problems listed below in the future.

# Modern Problems
- 🏙  **Urban environments are not good for us.** Living in plant-less boxes in huge concrete jungles is not good for us. Studies have shown that this plant-less lifestyle has a negative impact on our physical and mental health - see [[The science behind the mental and physical benefits of plants]].
- 😰 **Long-term stress is not good for us.** Our bodies are designed to deal with intense but short amounts of stress, e.g. being chased by a lion. It is *not* designed to cope with the long-term stress that comes from worrying about the economy, job security, what our favourite celebrities are up to, etc.
 - 📱 **Modern media is not good for us.** The profit-and-outrage-driven 24/7 news cycle, intense social media use, and our access to an endless stream of conten is not good for us.
 - 🤩 **Instant gratification is not good for us.** We live in [[The age of instant gratification]] with content, food, and more on demand. This shallow form of instant gratification is not good for us - what is good is the long-term gratification born of effort and struggle. 
 - 🍩 **Processed food is not good for us.** As a general rule, the more processed an item of food is, the worse it is for us. Food has been weaponised with refined sugar.
 - 🪑**The sedentary lifestyle is not good for us.** Our bodies are designed to be used intensely and regularly. 8 hours at a desk followed by sitting for dinner, TV, gaming, phone use, etc, is not good for us.
 - 👨🏻‍💻 **Having many shallow relationships is not good for us.** We are social animals, designed to have a small but deeply connected group of friends. The world is not more connected, it just gives this illusion; in reality we are more alone than ever as people have less close friends but more 'online friends' that they don't know as well.
 - 🧼 **Cleaning our environments too well is not good for us.** This is the [[Hygiene Hypothesis]].
 - 🔁 **[[Hyper-novelty]]** is not good for us and lets markets hijack our brains. 


I believe the above to be the main contributors to the many physical and mental health crisises affecting the world in 2021 (COVID not included).

# Combatting The Modern Problem
It seems to me that the main principle here is as follows:
> 🌴 The further we deviate from the [[Hunter-Gatherer Lifestyle]], the more our mental and physical health will be negatively affected.

**How can you change your life to be more in tune with nature and our natural way of life, without sacrificing your priorities?**

I find it beneficial to, as a [[Thought Experiments|Thought Experiment]], consider Mother Nature to be our Mother: if you listen to her and let her look after you, you'll be all the better for it. If you don't listen to your Mother, if you ignore her advice, things won't go as well for you.
Most of us have done away with Mother Nature to some degree,  and this is taking a slow but steady toll on our physical and mental health.

It is important that we take an optimistic outlook on this - to see it as a problem we can overcome - as opposed to taking a pessimistic outlook. For more on this check out [[The Importance of Optimism VS Pessimism]]
