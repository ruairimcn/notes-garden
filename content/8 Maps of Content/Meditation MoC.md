# Meditation MoC
**Summary**:: My notes on meditation, through a secular and scientific lense.

# Books
[[The Way of Liberation]] - An excellent, short book on [[Non-Dual Meditation]] by [[Adyashanti]]

[[The Mind Illuminated]] - Excellent book on [[Samatha Vipassana Meditation]], very detailed and nuanced but manageable for an interested beginner. The book that convinced me meditation was worth doing.

I recommend one or both of the above books for anyone looking to get a good intro to and start in meditation!

[[The Direct Path]] - A series of 'glimpse' exercises for [[Non-Dual Meditation]] by [[Adyashanti]]

[[Theory of Everything]] - A good semi-fictional book on life after enlightenment 

[[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]] - A big book that goes into a lot of detail but is worth a flick around. Good info on [[The Three Trainings]]
