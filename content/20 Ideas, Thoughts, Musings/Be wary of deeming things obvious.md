'Everyone is aware of this...'
'It is obvious that...'

These are phrases I come across a lot, especially the latter, and I have been thinking these phrases might be used more than they should be.

I think one has to be careful in their use and would want to be sure of their readership before using such terms, as they may alianate people who don't whatever is under discussion to be 'obvious'.
