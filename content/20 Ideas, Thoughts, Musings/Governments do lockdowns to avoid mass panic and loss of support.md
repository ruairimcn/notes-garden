One of the core  arguments surrounding covid is the usefulness of lockdowns and to what degree countries should be adopting them.
Almost all countries seem to be using lockdowns as their primary tool against covid - aside from vaccines.

Let's compare it with the alternative, not locking down a country or parts of it.
This will result in:
- Increased hospital and ICU admissions, eventually reaching the stage where capacity is exceeded and some people cannot receive care on time, both with delayed hospital admissions and delayed ambulance call-outs. In some countries, such as India, people are being left to die on the strees due to lack of space and equipment such as oxygen tanks.
- Increased deaths due to covid.
- Increased long-term health issues due to long covid.

All of the above will cause a rise in fear and panic amongst the population, as people, particularly in developed nations, except a certain level of healthcare, which the government will eventually be unable to provide to all citizens if lockdowns are not carried out. 

My arguent is that **it is the rise of fear and panic in the general population that motivates countries to enforce lockdowns.**

# Though experiment: Robot Population
Imagine that only the elected government in each country are thinking and feeling humans; the rest of us are mere machines, cyborgs, unthinking and unfeeling cogs in the economical machine.

From this outlook, I think it makes utilitarian sense to not do lockdowns. Instead of crippling your nation's economy by shutting down most industries via lockdowns, just let covid run its course. People will fall ill and die, and some hospitals will be unable to cope. But we are comparing the death of hundreds or of thousands of people (depending on the country) to causing the following for millions of other people:
- Recession, 'fiscal crisis', rising unemployment.
- Mental and physical health issues caused by isolation. There are already arguments being made that lockdowns do more physical and mental harm than good.
- A future of higher tax and national debt that must be paid off
- Disrupting education
- Rise of black markets 
- and other negatives not listed here

Given a population of robots who will do what they are told, opting to **not lockdown** seems the rational choice to me. If emotions and feelings (and wanting to minimise deaths) are taken out of the picture, I think a nation is likely better off not locking down and not taking a hit on debt levels, GDP, and general health and wellbeing of the majority of the population.

But that is not the case; we are a population of thinking, feeling, sentient beings whose governments have promised us certain fundamental human rights. 
Given enough fear and panic, or outrage and loss of trust, the people usually have the ability to overthrow their government, either democratically or through protest and force.

## Safety Net
Each country has its own 'safety net' that it will not allow (most) citizens to fall below. If hospitals are full and people are not getting ambulances on time, the population will see this as holes appearing in the safety net, and will begin to fear that the net will not catch them if they fall. And even if these holes are very, very small, they create a much larger, disproportional amount of fear in the minds of the nation's citizens, who all fear that the net may not catch them.  
**Our imaginary robot population is not concerned by this.** 

The documentary series [[The Century of the Self]] discusses how, after the two World Wars, democratic governments came to fear their populations. They saw how ordinary Germans had become heartless monsters, and they believed these animal instincts existed in the minds of **all** peoples. Consumerism was hence invented partially to control, subdue, and pacify the population.

I think this trend is continuing today, and that **the fear of the people rising up against them** is mostly what is pushing governments to enforce lockdowns.
