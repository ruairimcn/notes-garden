Brain Breaks are a concept from the book [[Brain-centric Design]]. They are short exercises one can do in between blocks of learning in order to take a break, get some exercise in, get their blood flowing, and release learning-enhancing neurotransmitters; all things that assist with learning.

# Neurology
- The cerebellum is engaged for balance and movement, and it assists with memory, language, and abstract thinking
- Blood flows to cerebral regions

# Brain Break Activities
## Crossing the midline
p.25

Two rubber balls needed.

Start with your dominant hand and bounce the ball on that side of your body as you count to five (ideally out loud).

Then bounce it with your less dominant hand on the other side. 

Then try bouncing on both sides

Then try to receive the balls with opposite hands in a crisscross manner. 

This activates both hemispheres of the brain, the corpus callosum, the temporal and parietal lobes, and the prefrontal cortex. 
Neurotransmitters that assist learning are released, as are [[Seretonin]], [[Oxycotin]], [[Dopamine]], and [[Norepinephrine]].

## Sixes
Standing or sitting, lift your right leg a bit and move your foot counterclockwise, in a circle. Simultaneously, draw the number six in the air with your right finger.

Switch to your left, and if that becomes easy, try reversing your foot circles to clockwise and drawing the number nine.


## Necker Cube
Draw the [[Necker Cube]], stand up, and try to switch perspective as quickly as possible.

## Fingertips
Stand up. Stretch your arms straight out in front of you, tilt your wrists up so your palms are facing you, and cross your arms to make an X. Keep your fingers up in the air and lock your thumbs together. With your index finger on your right hand, try to touch each of the fingertips of your other hand, one by one. Now take the index finger on your left hand and repeat the process. Try switching to use the middle, ring, and pinkie fingers on each hand.

As with previous brain breaks, the objective is to engage all regions of the brain in a simple but energizing activity that increases blood flow to the brain while also connecting the cerebellum, occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes to the prefrontal cortex. In addition, the act of attentional focus, surprise, and shared fun serves to flood the brainâ€™s synapses with neurotransmitters that assist the learning process.
