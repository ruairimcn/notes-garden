# Governments are institutions with their own own institutional interests
## Sowell and minimum wage law
[[Thomas Sowell]] argues that governments are not merely a representation or personification of the general will of the people, but that they are  institutions with their own institutial interests.

He gives the example of working at the US Deparment of Labor. They were responsible for working on and maintaining a minimum wage, and large proportion of the department at the time was committed to doing so. Hence they are motivated by their own interests to maintain a minimum wage, despite [[Arguments against minimum wage]], as removing it would result in a loss of work to do for them and possibly a loss of employment.
