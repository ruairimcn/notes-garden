A PDF documenting the state of [[Knowledge Management|personal knowledge management]] (PKM) by [[Ness Labs]].

# Market Overview
- **The market is booming.** New tools for 'thought' are hitting the market every day, from note-taking apps to propect management tools. *Switching costs are high, making the market competitive*, though users like to experiment so there is room for new players.
- **The market is becoming more and more integrated.** PKM tools now allow for managing audio and visual thought as well as text. APIs allow for connection with other tools via the likes of [[Zapier]].
- **Rise of indie thinkers**. Indie thinkers, also called thinkfluencers, are using dissemination tools to monetize their unique knowledge.


# Paradigm shift
Knowledge management is no longer resteicted to work environments and personal productivity; it is being used in many parts of life, with a shift from utility tools to tools for thought, and a shift from personal productivity to collective intelligence.


# The 5 C's of PKM
1. **Creation.** How knowledge is *generated*. Note-tkaing apps, writing apps, and visual tools.
2. **Circulation.** How knowledge is *disseminated.* Blogs, newsletters, social media, etc.
3. **Curation.** How knowledge is *collected.* Read-later apps, bookmarklets, visual boards.
4. **Collaboration.** How knowledge is *augmented*. Wikis, knowledge bases, distributed version control.
5. **Communities.** How [[Knowledge worker|knowledge workers]] *connect.*

# Software
The PDF provides an overview of many types of software for each of the above cycle steps, I won't cover those here as I have a software stack already.


# PKM Trends
## From utility apps to tools for thought
Software is increasingly geared towards supporting thought, by providing tools for *connecting* knowledge as opposed to merely *collecting* it.

[[Bi-directional linking]] is experiencing a revival, with software like [[Obsidian]] and [[Roam Research]] making it a key feature.

Tools are becoming more visual with many solutions out there for mind-mapping, white-boarding, and collaborative visual thinking.

Tools for [[Spaced Repetition Learning]] allow for help with learning and recalling information.

## Increased focus on collaboration
Software often comes with collaborative features:
- Publish notes online for others to view
- Allow others to contribute content
- Increased popularity of [[Digital Gardens]]; leanring in public with one's mistakes and their learning and work proces sout there for the world to see; see [[Work with the garage door up]].

# Opportunities in knowledge management
1. A super-connector for tools for thought. The market is fragmented, and setups like Zapier may feel overkill for most [[Knowledge worker|knowledge workers]].
2. An academy for [[Indie thinkers]], main contender is [[Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte]].
3. A more integreated recall solution for [[Spaced Repetition Learning]].
