This is an idea by [[Ray Dalio]], discussed in his excellent book [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]. It is one of [[My principles]].

# The Idea
The idea is that one will benefit from practicing radical honesty and transparency, in both personal and professional life, more than one would by not doing so.

## Why?
- [[Comparing principles helps to decide who to work with and what to work on]]. By being honest and transparent about my goals, principles and values, potential business/project/romatic partners can get to know me better and make a more informed decision about whether or not a partnership will be worthwhile.
- Honesty is the best policy. Keeping up a convincing web of lies takes mental effort and it will harm your personal relations and reputation if you are caught. It's arguably immoral to lie.
