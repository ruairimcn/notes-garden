The book [[How To Read a Book]] discusses the important difference between words and terms.

**Words**
- Have many meanings depending on the circumstance.


**Terms**
- Are a specific meaning or use of a word. Unambiguous.
- Are the basic building block for communicating knowledge.
- Do not exist in dictionaries.
- "a skilled use of words for the sake of communicating knowledge"


If an author uses a word in one way, and the reader interprets in a different way, they have exchanged words but *the reader has not come to terms with the author*. **Communication has not occurred, or at best it is incomplete.**

> ðŸ’¡ The presence of ambiguity indicates an absence of communication between reader and author.
