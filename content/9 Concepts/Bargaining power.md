Bargaining power is a measure of your ability to use your power to set terms in business that are more favourable than you.

# The Grid
Business book [[The Grid]] says the following:
Every business is situated between its customers and suppliers. Suppliers would love to charge you more to increase their profits, and customers are always looking for the best deal for themselves. As such, you are not only in competition with your rivals, but with your suppliers and competitors too.

Bargaining power is needed to avoid the squeeze of suppliers raising costs, or customers lowering prices, or both. It allowws you to get deals with suppliers and increase costs to customers, if you have it.

Be wary that **exploiting power can be dangerous by causing resentment.**
