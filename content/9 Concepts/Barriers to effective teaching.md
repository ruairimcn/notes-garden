- Educators need to deeply understand what they want to teach
- The world moves fast and contains a lot of information
- Many educators are entrenched in [[The Behaviourist Model of Education]]
- The educator is usually a subject matter expert and may struggle to work out what small portion of their huge repository of knowledge to teach. Where do you start? What do you teach first?
- Educators are often expected to convey huge amounts of information in a short amount of time. 
- Educators are up against the [[Cognitive Biases|cognitive bias]] called [[The Curse of Knowledge]] - they forget what it's like to be a beginner in their field and this makes it diffucult to effectively teach beginners.
- Educators cannot predict what concepts students will struggle with as each brain is unique. A class on load-bearing engineering will be understood differently by a builder than by a Newtonian physicist. 
- Subject matter experts are often the wrong person to stand in front of a class due to the above reasons.
