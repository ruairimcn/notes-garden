Kickstart inertia is the resistance we feel to 'kicking off' or starting a new piece of work, task, project, etc, I.E the procrastination we feel when starting something new or sitting down to work. 

# Ways to combat
## Do five minutes
The simplest way is to *just start with five minutes.* Once you do that, you will likely be able to keep up the momentum and do a solid block of work.

## Break it down into small tasks
For medium to large projects/jobs, break it down into smaller tasks. 
You don't have to break down the entire thing; writing down the first handful of tasks and just doing the first one or two will get you started.
