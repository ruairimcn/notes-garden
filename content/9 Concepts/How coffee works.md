Caffeine is the active ingredient in coffee.
Caffeine blocks the uptake of [[Adenosine]] in our brains; the buildup of adenosine in our brains is what makes us feel dired.
Once we wake up, adenosine starts to build in our brains. This build-up is what makes us tired. 

[[Sleep debt]] is where adenosine is not cleared entirely from our brains and rolls into the next day, reducing our wakefulness.

Caffeine blocks our adenosine receptors in our brain, slowing down the oneset of sleep. However, this creates a feedback loop as our brain adapts to this by creating more adenosine receptors, which means more caffeine is needed to get the same effect. This in turn can cause withdrawal effects when we stop using it, as we now have more adenosine receptors which makes us feel even more tired than usual. 

It takes 6 to 10 hours for caffeine to be fully processed by the liver, so it's important to not have it in the afternoon or evening; the earlier the better, though it is good to not have it first thing in the morning or our bodies can come to reply on coffee to wake us up; let your body wake naturally with exercise and sunlight, **then** have caffeine.

# Painting over the cracks
> ðŸ’¬ Caffeine gives us the **perception** of feeling awake when we are tired; every part of our body is indeed tired and in need of rest, we have merely used caffeine to block this feeling, this feedback, from being felt as strongly.
