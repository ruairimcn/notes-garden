> ðŸ’¬ **Momentum fuels motivation.**

If all we are working on is a long-term project that will take momths and has no finish line in sight, we will start to lack momentum and hence motivation. Slogging away with nothing concrete to show for it will eventually burn you out.

*The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it.*

**Excitement comes from doing something and then letting customers have at it.** So try to allow yourself quick wins to keep your spark alive. 

If you have to work on long-term projects, try to dedicate one day a week or similar to **small victories that generate enthusiasm, motivation, and momentum.**

The quicker you get thigns into the hands of customers, the better off you will be.
