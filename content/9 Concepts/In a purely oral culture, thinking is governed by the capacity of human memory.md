In such a culture, knowledge is what you can recall, and this is limited by what you can hold in your mind.

Hence, language evolved to aid the storage of complex information by making it easy to exchange info with others through speech:
- Dictation and syntax became highly rhythmical and tuned to the ear
- Information was encoded in common turns of phrase; clich√©s and metaphors.
- KNowledge was embedded in poetry, "composed in formulaic verse", distributed "by being sung or chanted aloud. "
