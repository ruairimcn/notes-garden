This note contains my pondering on the large role of people and their interactions (drama) in the entertainment industry.

# Stories are about People
While considering writing a short story, I realised that characters are almost always the most important part of any plot, more so than the scene and setting, weapons an objects, factions and countries, etc. These usually all exist as the backdrop on which various characters interact.

This makes sense from the view of [[Evolutionary Psychology]] as we are social beings that survived by working together in small groups, so getting on with other people became a hugely important skill.

We can call these interactions 'Drama' when they are used as entertainment, these interactions ranging from simply saying 'Good morning' up to full blow arguments involving multiple people. Sometimes they are non-verbal, only consisting of actions.


# Reducing Drama to Conflict
I think we can further reduce 'Drama' down to 'Conflict' as I think most drama has some sort of conflict at its core. I don't just mean conflict as in two groups of men shooting or hacking each other to death, I mean conflict as small as an argument between a couple. A mother scolding her son for not doing his homework, an employee being fired, any sort of clash of interests, goals, personalities, etc.

Can you think of a story that has **no conflict** in it? Any book, movie, TV show, drama, opera, etc, without any amount of conflict?

Maybe some songs and some paintings, but I think that by-and-large most of the media being consumed these days has some amount of conflict in it.

See [[Drama is Conflict]]


# The Online Death Machine
This topic is relevant to [[The Online Death Machine]], my term for the huge number of [[Digital Souls]] being 'killed' in video games.

These [[Digital Souls]] generally only exist as entertainment, which is drama, which is *almost always* conflict-drive. This can range from shooting human enemies in Call of Duty, to watching a boyfriend and girlfriend shout and argue in The Sims. 
> We appear to have a desire for conflict, even when just watching it or manipulating it in virtual environments. 


I think we can make the following statement:
> Most modern media, from TV shows to video games, is partially or deeply driven by the unfolding of a conflict between people, from a single couple all the way up to nations and planets. We are not just a 'social species', we are 'conflict-species'.


# Conflict in Men VS Women
I think men and women, in general, tend to engage in different types of 'conflict' to one another.

Men mostly engage in *physical* conflict; joining the military, participating in martial arts, playing violent video games, going to jail for assault or murder, etc.

Women mostly engage in *emotional* conflict; verbal combat, passive-aggressive behavior, etc.

I think the above is evident to anyone who went to a school that mixed boys and girls; girls hurt each other with gossip and maneuvering and manipulating within social circles, boys hurt each other with their fists and legs.

I think this makes men the more dangerous sex, and indeed I think the outcome (or the intended outcome at least) of most laws is the reduction of physical conflict engaged in by men.
