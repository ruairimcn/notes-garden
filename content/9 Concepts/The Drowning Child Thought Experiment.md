# The Drowning Child Thought Experiment
This [[Thought Experiments|Thought Experiment]] is related to [[Altruism]].

Imagine...
That you are out for a walk, when you notice a young child drowning in a lake. It's a shallow lake, one you can get into pretty easily and can likely rescue the child from without placing yourself in danger.

# Imagine....
## A drowning child

Imagine the following:
- The immense feeling of pride and satisfaction you will feel from saving a child from death.
- The feelings of gratitude the child will have towards you for saving their life.

This is likely an experience that you would remember and re-tell for the rest of your life.

Now consider how your opinion of a close friend would change if you heard that they were in this situation and they let the child drown.
While not illegal, it's fair to say that most people would consider this to be in poor taste at a minimum, and beyond that, perhaps morally reprehensible. You might start wondering whether or not they would save **you** in a similar scenarios.


## A stranger in need
Now consider this: **you can save a life right now.** By donating some of your money to an effective charity (or multiple charities) you can save one or more lives.
**The outcome for the recipient is the same in both cases.** The drowning child lives to see another day, and the recipient of your charitable donation does too; maybe it's a mosquito net to stave off malaria, or a life-saving operation.

**The outcome for you is not the same.** It feels a lot better to physically save someone than it does to donate money online and save someone you will likely ever meet or even know.

In both scenarios you are saving lives, but in one you feel like a hero, in the other you don't. 

This is a [[Moral illusion]]. Most people would save a life in a physical situation, but much less would regularly donate time or money to do the same.

# So what?
For me, this thought experiment convinced me that I should donate much more money to charity, and I've begun increasing how much I donate. I'm working towards donating 10% of all my money after tax from 2021 onwards. It's 5% at the moment. 

# How this illusion comes to be
How is it that so many of us act as if the world is fine? Spending money on luxurious items with money that could save lives?

Part of the reason is that modern life convinces us that 'everything is fine', that 'you can afford this.'
