From [[World-Systems Analysis]], this is a way of grouping countries in the modern world-system based on the types of productions they mostly rely on.

**It is the production processes and not the states** that are core-like or peripheral, and core-periphery is a **relational concept**, not a pair of reified terms. 

# Monopoly VS Free Market
The degree to which a process is relatively monopolized or relatively free market determines if it is core-like or peripheral. 

**Relatively monopolized** processes were much more profitable than free-market ones. This makes countries with more core-like processes wealthier. This leads to an flow of surplus value from peripheral to core states. 

[[Fernand Braudel]] insisted on a sharp distinction between free markets and monopolies, calling only monopolistic economies capitalism as he believed capitalism to be anti-market. 

He also came up with the *langue dur√©e*: the duration of a particular historical system, helping to avoid the trap of asserting 'timeless, eternal truths'; instead no systems are eternal, therefore having beginnings, lives during which they 'developed', and having terminal transitions into new (or old) systems.
