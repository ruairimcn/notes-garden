# Reverse Osmosis
Reverse Osmosis is possibly not as good for you as mineral water, this is something for me to do #FurtherResearch on.

[[How reverse osmosis works]]


## Removal of desirable minerals.
The main (and so far seemingly the only) disadvantage of reverse osmosis on human health is that some desirable minerals are removed from the water.

According to Wikipedia:
> 'Reverse osmosis per its construction removes both harmful contaminants present in the water, as well as some desirable minerals. Modern studies on this matter have been quite shallow, citing lack of funding and interest in such study, as re-mineralization on the treatment plants today is done to prevent pipeline corrosion without going into human health aspect. They do, however link to older, more thorough studies that at one hand show some relation between long-term health effects and consumption of water low on calcium and magnesium, on the other confess that none of these older studies comply to modern standards of research.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis#cite_note-32)'



## Study: "Health risks from drinking demineralised water"
This article is found on the website of the World Health Organisation:
[Health Risks from Drinking Demineralised Water](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf)
