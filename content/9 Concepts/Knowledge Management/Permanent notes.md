# Permanent notes
According to [[How to Take Smart Notes]];
'Permanent notes are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.'

In other words, they are standalone ideas/topics/concepts.

It is the nature of writing and of insight that you cannot immediately distinguish between a note that will be forgotten and a note that will grow into a major project. Hence, the threshold for writing a note must be as low as possible, while also being reviewed as soon as possible, before you forget its conext.

## Literature notes VS Main notes
Permanent notes should either be 
- Literature notes in your reference system. Can be brief as the context is the literature they come from.
- Main notes in [[The Slip-box]], must be written with more detail and care as they must be self-explanatory.
