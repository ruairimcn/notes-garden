When reading a book or other piece of literature, it is good to get the gist of of what you are reading as soon as possible, both for reading and understanding the material, and for later taking notes on it.

# Before/While Reading
Reading to get the overall idea/gist, and reading to drill down into and better understand the content, are two separate tasks.

To get the gist:
- Scan the table of contents
- Read some of the first and last chapters
- Scan through the book: 
	- Look at photos and diagrams
	- Check out the start and end of a v



# For taking notes
Generally, we take notes on specific parts of a book or piece of literature that we are interested in; not on the entire book.
To best do this, we need to understand the book and be able to pick out the info that is relevant to us - *this is a skill we need to use to improve.*

The abilities to
- Spot patterns
- Question the frames used
- Detect distinctions
are needed to think critically and extract value from a text. 

> ðŸŽ¹ Getting the gist of a piece and putting it into your own words is to writers the same as a pianist doing their daily practice
