# Fleeting notes
Fleeting notes are the opposite of [[Permanent notes]].
They are quickly written down, any which way, and will be discarded in a day or two once any info deemed useful/relevant is moved to [[Permanent notes]].

Underlining sentences or adding notes in book margins are also fleeting notes - they are useless unless you **do something with them.** If you know you won't revisit them, don't make them.

Fleeting notes are not useful unless reviewed within a day or two. 

## Purpose
- Capture ideas quickly while you're busy with something else: a conversation, lecture, what you're reading.
