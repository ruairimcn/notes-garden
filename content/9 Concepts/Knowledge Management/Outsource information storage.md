- It has its own unconscious processes for determining what is important enough to be moved from short to long-term storage
- It is not good at short-term storage; try remembering a random sequence of numbers for a whole day.

Digital and physical information storage is more reliable, more consistent for retrieval, and easier to search and manipulate than our squishy brains.

Storing information outside our brains also helps us to [[Get closure by writing things down]].
