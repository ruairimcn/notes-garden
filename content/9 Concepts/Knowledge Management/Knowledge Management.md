**Also known as:** Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

Knowledge Management is the process by which we add to, manage, grow, and connect any type of knowledge. I'm new to this topic and I am mainly leanring about it from Andy Matuschak, in particular his own website https://notes.andymatuschak.org/

This whole website (content created in [[Obsidian]] and published with [[Obsidian Publish]]) is my own effort at personal Knowledge Management.



# Getting Started with Knowledge Management
I am new to this area, but my initial advice based on what I've done so far, and on learning from experts on this topic, is to **dive right in.** Just get started creating and linking a few notes together in Obsidian (or whichever tool you choose).

I advise you get started with a topic that you have a good understanding of already and a deep interest in. For me this was [[Meditation]] and [[Buddhism]] and this made it easier for me to get excited about building out my notes.


# My System
The software I use is [[Obsidian]].

The knowledge management methods I use are
[[Atomic Notes]]
[[Evergreen Notes]]
[[Write notes in your own words]] and [[My notes are written for me]]

I have largely learned about the above two from the website of [Andy Matuschak](http://notes.andymatuschak.org).

Before choosing which software to use if you get into knowledge management, check out [[Choosing a PKM that suits you]]


## Overview
- Try to make notes as short as possible, i.e. break larger notes into smaller ones where possible ([[Atomic Notes]])
- Make as many high-quality links as you can between notes. [[Connecting vs. collecting notes]]

# Mind Mapping
I used to do frequent [[Mind Mapping]] with a tool called XMind but switched to using [[Obsidian]] as in many ways it is a better tool for the concept of mind mapping.
