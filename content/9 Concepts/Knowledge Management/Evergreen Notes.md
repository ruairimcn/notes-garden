# Evergreen Notes	

Developed by [[Andy Matuschak]] so best learned about on his website:
https://notes.andymatuschak.org/

The main idea is that your notes are written and managed in a way that they gain value overtime. [[Tend to your notes like a gardener]] so that they grow in value over time.

With Evergreen are aiming to develop insight, encourage serendipity, and come up with new information and ideas by combining and linking existing ones.

According to [[Andy Matuschak]] these are the main principles:
[[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]
[[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]
[[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
[[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]
