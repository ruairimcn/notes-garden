Out short-term memory is limited, we can free up space by offloading as much storage work as possible to our slip-box. 

Open tasks and projects exist as open loops in our head, floating around until
- It's forgotten
- Replaced by something more important (our brains decide this)
- Moved into long-term memory


This can be greatly supported by having and using a good [[Knowledge Management System]]
