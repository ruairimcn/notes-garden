Obsidian Sync is a paid service that encrypts and syncs your Obsidian notes across your devices.
Note it is also possible to sync notes across devices using services like Dropbox or Google Drive.

It costs $4 per month, this is lifetime earlybird pricing and it will eventually cost $8.

I have been using it for a few weeks at the time of writing and find it to be worthwhile, especially as I regularly use both an iPad and Macbook Pro for working with Obsidian.
