# My notes are written for me
I write my notes myself, to myself, for myself.
This was inspired by the note-taking advice of [[Andy Matuschak]].

# Advice
Because of this, you should take my advice with a grain of salt (as you should everyone's I think), because what worked for them won't neccessarily work for you. 
I'll say things like 'I advise you to' this or 'You should do' that, and while I do think these words through and aim to be have them be as true as possible, they won't work for everyone.
