# Niklas Luhmann
**Notes:** The below info is taken from the book [[How to Take Smart Notes]] and written in my own words.

Born December 8, 1927, LÃ¼neburg, Germany

Niklas Luhmann, the son of a German brewer, went to law school and worked as a public servant. He chose not to take part in the socialising that came as part of the job, working 9-5 and leaving to work on his passion: reading and following his interests in [[Philosophy]], [[Organisational Theory]], and [[Sociology]].

After taking notes for some time, he realised they were not leading anywhere (just like mine until discovering [[Obsidian]] and [[Knowledge Management]]!). So he turned the typical system around - instead of adding notes to existing categories or texts, he
1. Wrote them on small pieces of paper
2. Put a number in the corner
3. Collected them in one place - [[The Slip-box]]

> ðŸ’¡ Luhmann realised that one idea/note is only as valuable as its context, which isn't always the context it was taken from. He collected notes in his slip-box in such as way that the collection became more than the sum of its parts, by allowing him to relate notes to different contexts. '<br><br>*His slip-box became his dialogue partner, main idea generator and productivity engine. And it was fun to work with - because it worked.*'


This led him to enter acadamia, where it was suggested he become a professor of sociology. But he had none of the qualifications or papers/thesis' written that would be needed. Most would take this offer as a compliment but consider it impossible and move on.
Remarkably, **Luhmann turned to [[The Slip-box]] and used it to put together the two thesis' needed in lest than a year, while taking classes in sociology.** He became professor of sociology and held this position for the rest of his life.

He 
- Published a well-received book, [[The Society of Society]]
- Published 58 books and hundreds of articles in his 30 years, many becoming classics in their respective fields (not including translations of his).
- Had half a dozen books published after his death 
- Generated more ideas than he could write


His basic principles for note taking are so simple that some thought there must be a deeper secret - there is not! 

> ðŸ’¬ 'I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box.' - Luhmann.

It is not only the number and quality of his publications that makes him stand out, but also that these feats did not take a huge amount of effort. He stressed that he did what he liked, saying:
**'I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.'**
