**Links:** [[Andy Matuschak]] [[Knowledge Management]]

Andy is of the opionion (and I agree) that when writing [[Evergreen Notes]] it is best to write them for yourself - worry about making them accessible to an audience later.

I have often seen people in the [[Knowledge Management]] community say that, if you do [[Atomic Notes]] and [[Evergreen Notes]]well and build up a large, connected knowledge base on a concept or group of concepts, you have already created a solid base from which to put together a more longform public piece, be that a 
- Blog post
- Book
- Speech/public speaking
- Etc

There are many examples of use cases for this discussed on the  [[Obsidian]] [[Discord]] channel. People there are even publishing fiction books by using Obsidian to plan everything out. 

Andy points out that he can do both - write for himself **and an audience** at the same time,  but only if he understands the topic. So to avoid thinking he can do this all the time, he writes for himself by default and only explicity decides to write for an audience.

I will be following this principle on my own [[Obsidian Publish]] website (which is what you are on right now ðŸ¤“).
