Explicit, inplicit, and tacit are three different types of knowledge, and it is important to know the difference between them when doing knowledge management or when developing a knowledge management strategy.

[[Explicit Knowledge]]: Knowledge that is easy to articulate, write down, and share.
 
[[Implicit Knowledge]]: The application of explicit knowledge. Skills that are transferable from one job to another are one example of implicit knowledge.

[[Tacit Knowledge]]: Knowledge gained from personal experience that is more difficult to express.
