**Links:** [[Knowledge Management MoC]]
# Zettelkasten

The main concepts are 

**Inbox.** Used for storing bookmarks to resources, every little piece of information, anything that **may** make it into your main system, into your inbox here.

**Archive.** The main notes that you will keep for a long time. Try to keep this to **your thoughts on notes.**

**Literature notebook.** A notebook for taking notes on books and other literature.

Beware of the [[Collector's Fallacy]], you want to be a **Connector** of knowledge and not a **Collector** of knowledge.
