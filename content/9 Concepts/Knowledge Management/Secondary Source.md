A Secondary Source is an analysis or restatement of a primary source. Often they try to describe or explain primary sources.

They tend to be works that summarize, interpret, reorganize, or otherwise provide an added value to a primary source. 

**Examples:**
Textbooks, edited works, books and articles that interpret or review research works, histories, biographies, reviews of law and legislation, political analyses and commentaries.
