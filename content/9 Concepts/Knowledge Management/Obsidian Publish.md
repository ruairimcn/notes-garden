# Benefits
I have found Obsidian Publish to be a very useful and valuable tool:
1. **It helps me to publish content quicker.** I tend to get bogged down in the details when it comes to sharing knowledge with the world, and had several failed attempts at sticking with a blog. But since I'm writing many [[Atomic Notes]] that are linked and improved over time, I find it's easier to start writing immediately and share with people immediately. Related to this is [[Work with the garage door up]]
2. **Ease of use.** With Obsidian Publish I don't have to worry about hosting, plugin updates, or even what the website looks like as it's beautiful and has great features right away. Yes it's a lot more limited than what I'm used to, [[WordPress]], but this is actually a benefit for me as I can focus on the writing. 
3. **Real-world feedback and movitation**

# Pricing
I pay $8 a month for Obsidian Publish, though this is 'Earlybird lifetime pricing' and they plan to make it $16 a month eventually, per website. 
Is it expensive? Yes. But for me it's worth it for regular/heavy Obsidian users with an interest in sharing their [[Second brain]] online.
