I publish the majority of my notes on Obsidian Publish, meaning most of my notes are viewable to the public.
This is part of my effort to practice the principle of [[Practicing Radical Honesty and Transparency]]. I see value in someone being able to find out as much about me as possible, e.g. to know if I'm a good fit to work with ona project.

I have also replaced my WordPress blog/website with Obsidian Publish.

Here is some advice on using Obsidian Publish in this way.

# 1: Make notes private by default
I have a folder called 'PRIVATE' that is never published. 
I have a folder in here for new attachments and another for new notes, in Obsidian's settings I have these set as the new location for attachments and notes.
This makes notes and attachments private by default.

The reason for this is **it's better to accidentally make a public note private, instead of a private note public.** Accidents can happen and it's better for the accident to be a note intended for the public to be private for a while.

I used to have public folders for new notes and attachments, but this meant if I forgot to move a new note or attachment to the private folder, it was going to get published. 
While I don't have any deep secrets that would get me into trouble, I'd rather not put my daily journal entries online, not for now anyways! 

So for peace of mind, make notes private by default


# 2: Make your entry page like a website home page
I used to direct people straight to the 'entryway' into my knowledgebase - [[10 My Second Brain]] - but once I started using Obsidian Publish as my main website, I created a new page, [[0 Welcome]]
This is to cater to people who are not looking for my knowledgebase, typically
- My contact information
- Links to my two current business ventures
- My [[20 My Blog|Blog]] (more on this below)


# Create a 'Blog' page if you blog
I have a [[20 My Blog|Blog]] page as I make a distinction between my [[Permanent notes]]/[[Evergreen Notes]] (shorter, standalone notes), and blog posts, which are technically notes but usually written in a more long-form format. 

This lets people read my 'main' writings easily, and if they are so inclined they can delve deeper into my smaller notes.
