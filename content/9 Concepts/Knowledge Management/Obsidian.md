Obsidian is software (available on most common platforms) for note storage, connecting, and management. It is often used for [[Knowledge Management]].

It is completely free to use. Two paid features [[Obsidian Sync]] and [[Obsidian Publish]] are availalble but are entirely optional.

[The official website](https://obsidian.md) will elegantly present all of its features to you, but my personal reasons for using it are:
1. **It's simple yet powerful.** Said another way, Obsidian itself is a simple-to-use piece of software that you can pick up in minutes, but you could spend hours studying [[Knowledge Management]] and weeks or years building out a [[Second brain]] in Obsidian.
2. **You control your files.** Everything you create in Obsidian is stored on your local computer, notes are stored as markdown files. Many similar services are hosted entirely online - if they go down you can't access your notes, and you never know when such [SaaS] software might close shop or have a data loss disaster.
3. **I love the graph feature.** Watching this grow is a pleasure. 
4. **It's ideal for [[Evergreen Notes]]** and as I have come to love and respect this system of note taking, Obsidian is the tool for me. 
5. **Combined with [[Obsidian Publish]] it lets me share my knowledge with the world in a shorter space of time than a blog.** This is more of a personal issue - I was spending too much time worrying about what to write and how to write it. Now I write regularly and edit later. See [[Work with the garage door up]].
6. **My notes are effortlessly synced across phone, tablet, and laptop** with their paid service [[Obsidian Sync]].
7. **It's pretty :)**




# Current Plan of Action
I've decided to focus on populating Obsidian with [[Evergreen Notes]] on topics that deeply interest me, to the exclusion of blogging. That might change depending on how this experiment goes, but my feeling is I'll be staying with Obsidian.
