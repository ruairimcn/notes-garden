When reading literature, one should have a pen in hand to take notes. 

[[Reading is an active not a passive act]] and writing notes helps to make it more of an active act.

[[Writing notes is better than typing notes]] because the slower pace of writing forces your brain to write selectively and work out what is important, both from the perspective of the text and from your own interests. This engages your brain with the text and enhances understanding, which enhances learning/remembering. 
To get the benefits of both, you can use a digital pen and tablet; see [[How I write notes while reading]].

You should [[Write notes in your own words]]. It is a good way to test your understanding, and to give notes maximum value we should re-phrase them in the context of our own thinking (without changing the meaning to fit our own needs). To copy notes verbatim lessens their value as they are isolated from their original meaning.

Note length varies, the key is that they contribute to the whole, the whole being our [[Second brain]]. Work towards creating a critical mass of notes. 

Highlighting and note-taking in the margins is valuable but only if we re-visit them soon after and work them into [[Permanent notes]].

Literature notes should be short, their only purpose is to help us write better [[Permanent notes]]; everything else is a distraction!
