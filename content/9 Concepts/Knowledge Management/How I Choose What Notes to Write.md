Some of the topics I enjoy writing notes on, and hence have many notes on, are deep and broad topics, e.g. [[Buddhism]] and [[Evolutionary Psychology]].

So I will write notes on the parts that I both enjoy and understand well enough to write my notes on. I link to sources for material that is relevant but that I either don't know enough about to make notes or am not interested in enough to make notes :)

When reading literature, it is best to be selective about what content to really drig into, summaries, and turn into [[Evergreen Notes]]; by knowing my interests I can choose what is relevant to me and just focus on that.
