"When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process... This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid." - Arthur Schopenhauer

Many authors in the [[Knowledge Management]] space say that it's best to try and make your Knowledge Library/Vault/Second Brain as much of your own writing as possible, and less of other people's.
e.g. write down your thoughts and opinion on a book where possible, as opposed to copying it in verbatim.
