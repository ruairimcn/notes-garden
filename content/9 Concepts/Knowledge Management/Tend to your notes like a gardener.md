# Tend to your notes like a gardener
I first came across this phrase on the [[Obsidian]] website, screenshot below.
Just as a gardener tends to the individual plants in their garden to nurture them and grow them into flourishing plants, so should we tend to our [[Knowledge Management]] system and its contents with care and attention, in order to help it grow and flourish.

The analogy works because your collection of notes, if used and added to in a certain way (see [[Knowledge Management]] and [[How to Take Smart Notes]] for a look into some methods), will grow over time and become more than the sum of its parts by generating new ideas and insights.
