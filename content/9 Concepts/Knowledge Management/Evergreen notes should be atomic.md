Notes should be small and only about one thing, but should capture that one thing in its entirety; doing so is a way of creating [[Evergreen Notes]]

According to [[Andy Matuschak]];
*This way, it's easier to form connections across topics and contexts. If your notes are too broad, you mught no notice when you encounter some new idea about one of the notions contained within, and links to that note will be muddied. If your notes are too fragmented, you'll also fragment your link network, which make make it harder to see ceetain connections. [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]*

A big benefit I have experienced myself is that **[[Atomic Notes]] allow people to get a high-level overview of something, with the option to dive in deeper if they want.**

As an example I have a longform post about my first meditation retreat:
[[May 2021 Pa Pae Meditation Retreat]]
Friends of mine who read this and already have an interest and understanding of [[Buddha]] and [[Meditation]] can read this retreat report and not have to click into as many notes as someone who doesn't have this interest or understanding. They understand some or all of the related concepts already.

But readers who don't understand these topics so much, or at all, can simply pick and choose the ones they would like to learn more about. They can go as far down the rabbit hole as they like, and return to the main notes when they are ready. 

I really like this! And it helps with [[Knowledge Management]]
