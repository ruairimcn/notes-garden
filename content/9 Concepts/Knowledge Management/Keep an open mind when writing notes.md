It is important to keep an open mind when writing notes in order to combat [[Confirmation Bias]]. 


As this bias is 
- rampant amongs us humans
- difficult to spot (we're usually unaware of it)
- likely exacerbated by the [[Information Age]] and the [[Echo bubble effect]]
it is important to actively do something about it.

There are two main ways to combat confirmation bias:
1. [[Write from the bottom-up]]; read widely, follow your interest, and see what topics naturally emerge and interest you, instead of trying to choose a topic to start off with.
2. Change your focus from trying to find confirming facts, to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information, in an agnostic manner. Throw the net wide; the tighter the net, the more likely confirmation bias is likely to sneak in.


The traditional linear, top-down process of writing is much more susceptible to confirmation bias, as by starting from a fixed premise and trying to back it up, the bias will kick in and make us favor confirming information.
[[Charles Darwin]] countered this by forcing himself to write down (and therefore comteplate) arguments against his theories. 

*'If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong.'*
And this is more likely to happen if you write top-down instead of bottom-up.

Don't have a hypothesis in mind at all times, instead:
1) Allow your focus to flow, don't shackle it with preconceived ideas.
2) Give a true and accurate account of the content.
3) Find relevance and make connections. Shift attention from individual projects to making more useful and open connections, regardless of the project.


# Disconforming facts
Prime yourself to seek, understand, and appreciate them. You can work towards a mental state of enjoying discovering disconforming facts.
