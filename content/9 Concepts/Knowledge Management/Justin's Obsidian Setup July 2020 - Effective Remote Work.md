- Most note systems are based around Temporary VS Permanent notes, e.g. [[Evergreen Notes]] and [[Zettelkasten]]
- Temporary notes are things you qant to quickly capture; tasks, ideas, goals, etc. Capture now, integrate later. 
- Permanent notes are pieces of knowledge that you want to work on, reference later, find easily, and integrate with further knowlede in the future.
- Permanent notes are [[Atomic Notes]], e.g.
- Star Wars > The Force > Jedi > Luke Skywalker is a Jedi.
