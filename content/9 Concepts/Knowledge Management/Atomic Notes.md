Atomic notetaking means breaking down notes into their smallest possible constituent parts. It is related to the [[Evergreen Notes]] method.


# My Practice
The below is how I personally apply Atomic noting to my note writing and knowledge management.


## The Smallest Possible Part
Atomic note taking gets it name from atoms being the smallest thing anything can be reduced down to; i.e. our notes should be reduced down to the smallest possible topic/subject/principle/item.

A good example I've seen given is 
Star Wars > Jedi > Luke Skywalker
You would call the note "Luke Skywalker" instead of having one big note called "Star Wars" with everything you know about it in one long list. 

Instead, your Star Wars note is an 'Index' or 'starting point' or [[0 What is a Map of Content?|Map of Content]] that points to other notes.

As an example using dummy notes:
![[Star Wars]]

Clicking through to The Jedi would show:
![[The Jedi]]

And clicking into Luke: 
![[Luke Skywalker]]



## Benefits
The smaller a note is, or the more concise it is, the more you can easily link it to other relevant/connected topics.

e.g my note on the book [[The Shallows]] is quite long as I started off by putting my notes in there. Then, either while putting notes into it, or afterwards when reviewing the note, I break it up into smaller parts like 
[[Our intellectual maturation can be seen in the way we draw pictures and maps]]

This is beneficial because now, instead of having to link to an entire book, I can link to specific topics. 

The smaller the note, the more potential there is for connections.
e.g. with 10 notes you might have 20 or so connections/links between notes, but with 100 notes you might have 300 or so connections.
