Mind Mapping is a way of doing [[Knowledge Management]] and [[Spaced Repetition Learning]].

It works by starting off with a central topic in the middle, and branching out from here by ways of categories/topic hierarchy, going into more and more detail branch by branch.

I've seen it used for very short plans, all the way up to in-depth book notes.

I personally used Mind Mapping for about a month and was planning on using it more, but I've now replaced Mind Mapping with [[Obsidian]].

Note that in the below writings, Mind Mapping refers to the traditional method shown below, with one topic in the center. I am making this distinction because the way Obsidian is used could be seen as a form of mind mapping.

## The Argument for Mind Mapping
My basic understanding is that Mind Mapping can be better for some people when it comes to taking notes, as linear thinking (writing from the top to bottom of a page) isn't how our brains work, or like to work - instead our brains make connections between many different ideas. Mind Mapping lets us create a branch or web ideas out from one core concept.


## Why I changed to Obsidian
Obsidian lets me connect any note/topic/idea to any other in my Obsidian Vault.
Mind Mapping is restricted to the current Mind Map. You could reference other Mind Maps to make a kind of link, but this is nowhere near as effortless and useful as Obsidian's ability to link notes.

> ðŸ’¡With Mind Mapping, I end up with many** individual and disconnected** Mind Maps.
With Obsidian, I end up with **one big interconnected Mindmap.**

I think Obsidian is similar to Mind Mapping in many ways and is a better way of accomplishing networked thinking. **Obsidian is decentralised, whereas Mind Mapping is centralised around one central topic.**
