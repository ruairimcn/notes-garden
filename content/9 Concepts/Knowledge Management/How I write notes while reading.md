This is [[Ruairi McNicholas|my]] current system for writing notes while reading a book.

# 1: Writing notes as I go
If the book is around my current level of reading/understanding, I will take notes as I go, always by pen because [[Writing notes is better than typing notes]].
Sometimes this is via my iPad and Apple Pencil on a great app called GoodNotes, and sometimes it is with a physical pen and notebook; the location isn't too important as these are temporary [[Literature notes]] that will soon be turned into permanent notes.


If the book is above my level of reading/understanding, I will simply highlight as I go, to speed up my progression through the book. Then, once I have finished it, I will read through it again, writing notes as I go, with my highlights showing the areas I am mainly interested in. 

I try to [[Write notes in your own words|write notes in my own words]] as this is a great way of testing yourself to see if you understand the material.


# Turning Literature Notes into Permanent Notes

Having finished the book, I now have my own written notes on it.
The next step is to turn these [[Literature notes]] into [[Permanent notes]] that will stay inside my [[Second brain]].

This process lets me re-purpose and divide up/combine temporary book notes into permanent notes that **add value to my second brain/knowledge management system.
