Knowledge work rarely involved deliberate practice to improve at core skills, unlike athletes and musicians who actively work on improving certain skills.

Knowledge workers do "grow" by changing job, career, position, taking on challenging projects, etc. But their day-to-day work is focused on doing their job, *not* at improving existing skills. 
This is like an entrepreneur constantly working *in* their business to the detriment of working *on* it; it might grow and improve over time, but not as efficiently as it would if the owner spent time working on improving specific parts.

This is exacerbated by the fact that [[Typical work and performance environments don't constitute deliberate practice]]
