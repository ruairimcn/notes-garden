A term made popular by [[Buckminister Fuller]] that describes [[Earth]] as a spaceship moving through space, for the purpose of encouraging cooperation amongst its 'crew'.

It's a [[Thought Experiments|thought experiment]] that is used to promote altruism, compassion, and cooperation.
If you were on a large spaceship - dependent on a variety of life support systems to keep everyone alive - it would make sense to cooperate with everyone in a way that helps everyone, right? That [[Utilitarianism]] would be adopted to some extent; it doesn't make sense for one compartment or section of the ship (think specific countries, cultures, groups etc), to gain benefits in the short-term that will potentially jeporadise the long-term for everyone else on the ship.

Of course it isn't as simple as this; Eart is a truly **massive** spaceship with a highly diverse mix of species and cultures, but the general principle still applies; this is, in essence, a giant spaceship floating through earth, and the actions we take will always have a positive or negative effect on the entire ecosystem.
