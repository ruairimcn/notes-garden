# My tech philosophy
Tech is shiny, tempting to buy, and expensive.
And money is in limited supply!

As such, I have a guide/philiosophy for how I buy tech:
> ðŸ’¡The amount I spend on tech is proportional to how much I use it and how much value I gain from it.

A good example is my laptop and phone.
I am a heavy laptop user, often spending 8 hours a day on it Mon-Fri for a typical week, both for work and personal use.
But I'm a very light phone user, actively trying to use my phone as little as possible.

As such I spent â‚¬3,000 on a top-tier Macbook Pro laptop, and about â‚¬300 on a Google Pixel 3a phone, as opposed to the â‚¬700-â‚¬1,000 I *could* spend on a top-tier Apple or Android phone.

The more expensive phones tend to be larger too; as I like to travel light and as I don't often use my phone for consuming media, the smaller the better for me.
