An old man says to his grandson:
'There's a fight going on inside me. It's a terrible fight between two wolves. 
One is evil - angry, greedy, jealous, arrogant, and cowardly. 
The other is good - peaceful, loving, modest, generous, honest, and trustworthy. 
These two wolves are also fighting within you, and inside every other person too.'

After a moment, the boy asks, 'Which wolf will win?'
The old man smiles.
'The one you feed.'
