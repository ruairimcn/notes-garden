Negative Visualisation is a practice from [[Stoicism]].

# Instructions
[[Buddhism]] teaches us that much, if not all, of our suffering comes from our desire and aversion, our craving for things to be one way or another.

However, we can use our appreciating of something to reduce stress and anxiety, by imagining ourselves in a position where we lose that thing.
E.g. if I meditate on the idea of losing my girlfriend in a car crash, it can make me more appreciative of my girlfriend in the present. 

It is also a way to reflect on [[Impermanence]]
