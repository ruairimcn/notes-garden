In his book [[Stillness is the Key]], [[Ryan Holiday]] discusses how US President Kennedy succeed in handling the Cuban Missile Crisis by having himself and everyone around him slow down in order to better think about the problem before them.

Holiday writes
"This is, in fact, **the first obligation of a leader and a decision maker.** Our job is not to 'go with our gut' or fixate on the first impression we form about an issue. No, we need to be strong enough to resist thinking that is too neat, too plausible, *and therefore almost always wrong* Because **if the leader can't take the time to develop a clear sense of the bigger picture, who will? If the leader isn't thinking through all the way to the end, who is?**"

A leader (and perhaps all men and women) should be, according to Holiday:
- Careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream
- Alert as a warrior in enemy territory
- Courteous as a guest
- Fluid as melting ice
- Shapable as a block of wood
- Receptive as a valley
- Clear as a glass of water

We will all face crisis in our lives. 
"What we will need then is the same stillness that Kennedy drew upon. His calmness. His open-mindedness. His empathy. His clarity about what really mattered. In these situations we must"
- Be fully present
- Empty our minds of preconceptions
- Take our time
- Sit quietly and reflect
- Reject distraction
- Weight advice against the counsel of our convictions
- Deliberate without being paralyzed
