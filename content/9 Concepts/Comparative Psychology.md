Comparative psychology is a sub-branch of [[Psychology]] that aims to understand human cognition and psychology by contrasting it with that of other species. 

# Homologies and Analogies
A homologous trait between species is evidence that they share a common evolutionary ancestor, and an analogous trait highlights the fact that evolution can arrive at the same adaptation, e.g. birds and bats can both fly but don't share a common ancestor.
