# Desalination begins
Desalinated or demineralised water is defined as
*'water almost or completely free of dissolved minerals as a result of...' * 	a list of methods.

The desalination process began in the 1960's and while not initially widely used, the former USSR did public health research on desalination as they began using it to produce drinking water in some cities. It was clear from the outset that desalinated water might not be fully appropriate for consumtption without enriching it with further minerals, for three main reasons:
1. Demineralised water is *highly aggressive*, meaning storage in tanks and distribution in popes is not possible as it attacks the materials they are made of, leaching metal and other materials from pipes and plumbing.
2. It tastes poor.
3. There was evidence at the time that some substances in water have a positive effect on human health, and some have adverse effects. E.g. a study reported lower morbidity and mortality from some cardiovascular (heart) diseases in areas with hard water.

These findings caused researches to focus on two main areas:
1. Possible adverse health effects from demineralised water
2. Finding out the minimum and the optimum contents of relevant minerals in drinking water to improve human health. Previously, the focus was on reducing toxic substabces in water, not on possible adverse effects due to missing some minerals.


**My thoughts:**
Straight away I'm concerned by what demineralised water does to pipes. If it can damage pipes used in plumbing, surely the organic pipes in our bodies - blood vessels, intestines, are no different? 


# Taste and thirst-quenching
The study notes that distilled and low mineral content water can taste bad (can have negative taste characteristics) but that consumers might adapt to this over time. 
It also notes that distilled water is reported to be less thirst quenching.


# Negative health effects
The study lists many possible negative health effects, some from studies that may have had issues, but that overall there is enough data to warrent choosing mineral water.

I have picked out some of the main negatives below (this list is not exhaustive). Some have only been found in rats:
- Negative effect on [[Homeostasis]] mechanisms
- Increased urine output 
- Lower volume of red blood cells
- Reduced skeletal ossification
- Increased risk of death and illness from cardiovascular disease

## Water intoxication:
From the article:
*'Nevertheless, severe acute damage, such as hyponatremic shock or delirium, may occur following intense physical efforts and ingestion of several litres of low-mineral water (10). The so-called "water intoxication" (hyponatremic shock) may also occur with rapid ingestion of excessive amounts not only of low-mineral water but also tap water. The "intoxication" risk increases with decreasing levels of TDS. In the past, acute health problems were reported in mountain climbers who had prepared their beverages with melted snow that was not supplemented with necessary ions. A more severe course of such a condition coupled with brain oedema, convulsions and metabolic acidosis was reported in infants whose drinks had been prepared with distilled or low-mineral bottled water'*
(part about infants is relevant to [[Parenting]])

# Recommended mineral amounts
I'm not sure if I'll ever be looking at a label for the mineral content of water, I might only be able to choose between demineralised and mineralised water. But you never know, so from this study:

*'Based on the currently available data, various researchers have recommended that the following levels of calcium, magnesium, and water hardness should be in drinking water. At these concentrations, minimum or no adverse health effects were observed.'*


| Mineral              | Minimum       | Optimum         |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Magnesium            | 10 mg/L       | 20-30 mg/L      |
| Calcium              | 20 mg/L       | 50 mg/L (40-80) |
| Total water hardness | 2 to 4 mmol/L |                 |
|                      |               |                 |


# Making up the difference with food
One could try to make up for the lack of minerals in demineralised water via eating solid food, however the article notes, after listing negative health benefits in rats, that
'*Apparently the reduced mineral intake from water was not compensated by their diets, even if the animals were kept on standardized diet that was physiologically adequate in caloric value, nutrients and salt composition.*'
