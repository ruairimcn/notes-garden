By looking at [[Allocation trade-offs]] and [[Design constraint trade-offs]], we see how evolution forces organisms to make trade-offs:

**Allocation:** A deer has limited energy to use for the growth and operation of parts of its body; if it wants bigger antlers, it must make something else smaller or must consume more calories. 

**Design:** A design constraint trade-offs are unaffected by supplementation - you can't add more resources to solve the problem, as the problem is one of design. As an example, speed cannot be increased without sacrificing mobility; a bird cannot fly with a lot of speed and mobility.

By using external phenotypes such as tools, buildings, weapons, etc, we can overcome some trade-offs.

E.g. we sacrificed our combat abilities for bigger brains and nimble arms and hands; we no longer have claws, fangs, or the muscle strength of our monkey cousins. 
However, our ability to make and use weapons lets us overcome this trade-off.
