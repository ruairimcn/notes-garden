World-systems analysis removes the 'nation state' as the standard unit of analysis, replacing it 'historical systems', of which three types exist:
- Minisystems
- 'World-systems' of two kinds: *world economies* and *world empires.*

>ðŸ’¬ 'On the whole, historians had been analyzing national histories, economists national economies, political scientists national political structures, and sociologists national societies. **World-systems analysts raised a skeptical eyebrow, questioning whether any of these objects of study really existed, and in any case *whether they were the most useful loci of  of analysis.***'

We are not talking about systems or economies *of the whole world*, rather of systems, economies, empires *that are a world* and that don't always encompass the entire globe. 

>ðŸ’¬ 'We are dealing with a spatial/temporal zone which cuts across many political and cultural units, one that represents an integrated zone of activity and institutions which obey certain systemic rules.'

The case has been made that the modern world-economy was a capitalist world-economy; not the first world-economy ever but the first world-economy to survive as such for a long period and thrive, and that it did this precisely by becoming fully capitalist. 

World-systems analysis don't defer to traditional boundaries of the social sciences, and they analyze social systems over the langue durÃ©e.

Hence their triple set of critiques is
1. World-systems rather than states as a unit of alaysis
2. Insistence on the long use durÃ©e
3. Undisciplinary approach
