Our tasks that need doing can be measured in two ways:
- Attractive or unattractive
- Productive or productive

This gives us a matrix with four types of work:

|                  | **Unattractive** | **Attractive** |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Productive**   | Necessary work                | Purposeful work              |
| **Unproductive** | Unnecessary work                | Distracting work             |           



**Necessary work** is unattractive but productive, e.g. team meetings, budget reviews.
**Unnecessary work** is both unattractive and unproductive. "Busy work."
**Distracting work** is unproductive but attractive and/or stimulating, e.g. Slack/chat, news websutes,, reddit, etc. 

**Purposeful work** is the sweetspot - both productive and attractive. Few tasks fit in here and those that do usually require a lot of brain power and benefit from [[10 Literature Notes/Books/Deep Work]].

By deciding on what work to focus on and complete, instead of allowing this to be done on [[Attention Autopilot]], allows us to spend less time on unproductive work, and more time on productive work, regardless of how attractive the work is.
