Too much information is sent to our brain every day from our five senses, on top of the constant stream of thoughts and emotions in our minds. 
To handle this, our brain is selective about what it pays attention to. As such, what we consciously focus on and direct our attention to dictates what will be selected to move from greater awareness to selective attention.

Put another way, **you are the architect of your experience.** You pull the weeds and plant the seeds that you want to cultivate.

# Examples
As an example, if you buy a new car, you will start 'seeing' this type of car more often on the roads; they were always there before, your mind just wasn't paying attention to them.
