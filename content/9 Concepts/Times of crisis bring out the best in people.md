Times of crisis have often been shown to bring out the best in people.
This is often unexpected as many people believe that times of crisis bring out the worst in people.

This is why [[Rutger Bregman]] uses this finding as an argument in his book [[10 Literature Notes/Books/Humankind]] that most people are decent inside.

# Examples
## Blitz of London
Before Nazi Germany commenced its bombing blitzz of London, both the German and British military believed that the English citizens living in London **would be psyschologically unable to deal with the bombing and would fall into mass panic and hysteria.**

This did not happen. Of course there was saddness, grief, and fury among the population, but 
- psychiatric wards stayed empty
- Alcoholism declined
- Public mental health improved
- There were fewer suicides than in wartime.

There was a strange serenity among the population, who managed to stay calm. People felt inspired and connected as they willingly gave of their time, money, food, and shelter, to help their fellow neighbors.

This has been shown to be true in other countries as well.
