Falling prey to the “fallacy of division” means you believe that a true statement about a population manifest in all individuals in the population.

E.g. it may be true of a population that 'men are stronger than women', but that doesn't mean you won't find a woman who is stronger than many men.

First described by [[Aristotle]].

This is a [[Logical Fallacies|logical fallacy]].
