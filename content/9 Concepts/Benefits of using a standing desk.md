We humans are designed to rise from sleep, do a lot of running around in order to find food, water, and mates, and then go back to sleep.
We are not designed to sit down - at an office desk, in a car, at our kitchen table, anhywhere - for large portions of the day.

This is especially true for [[Knowledge worker|Knowledge workers]] and others who use computers a lot, myself included. 
The problem of sitting is made worse by the incorrect use/lack of [[Ergonomics]] when it comes to computers, monitors and peripherals.

**The solution:** Get a desk you can stand at. 
Even better is to separate your screen from your keyboard if you use a laptop; it is better to be able to place each separately, i.e. use an external keyboard and mouse, as the best position for your keyboard is usually not the best position for your screen.


My own standing desk, located outside, is shown below.
