This list of logical fallacies is from https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com
This is by the same group who made the list I referenced for [[Cognitive Biases]]

**From the website**
*A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning. Logical fallacies are like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often very sneakily used by politicians and the media to fool people. Don't be fooled! This website has been designed to help you identify and call out dodgy logic wherever it may raise its ugly, incoherent head.*

**My goals:**
My purpose for putting together this list is to get better at spotting and arguing logically against these logical fallacies - in other people's arguments but more importantly in my own. 
And by having them as [[Atomic Notes]] in [[Obsidian]] I can better understand and learn about them by linking them to other relevant notes.


# List of Logical Fallacies

[[Ad Hominem]] - You attack your opponent's character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.

[[Ambiguity]] - You use a double meaning or ambiguity of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth.

[[Anecdotal]] - You use a personal experience or isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence.

[[Appeal to Authority]] - You say that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true.

[[Appeal to Emotion]] - You attempt to manipulate an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.

[[Appeal to Nature]] - You argue that because something is 'natural' it is there for valid, justified, inevitable, good, or ideal. 

[[Bandwagon]] - You appeal to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.

[[Begging the Question]] - You present a circular argument in which the conclusion was included in the premise. 

[[Black or White Argument]] - You present two alternative states as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.

[[Burden of Proof]] - You say that the burden of prof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove.

[[Composition/Division]] - You assume that one part of something has to be applied to all, or other, parts of it; or that the whole must apply to its parts.

[[Fallacy of Division]]

[[False Cause]] - You presume that a real or perceived relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other. 

[[Genetic]] - You judged something as either good or bad on the basis of where it comes from, or from whom it came.

[[Loaded Question]] - You ask a question that has a presumption built into it so that it couldn't be answered without appearing guilty.

[[Middle Ground]] - You claim that a compromise, or middle point, between two extremes must be the truth.

[[Naturalistic Fallacy]] - You assume that 'what is' in nature is 'what ought to be'. 

[[No True Scotsman]] - You make an appeal to purity as a way to dismiss relevant criticisms or flaws in your argument.

[[Personal Incredulity]] - When you find something difficult to understand or are unaware of how it works, you make out like it's probably not true. 

[[Planning fallacy]] - you underestimate how long a task will take to complete due to [[Optimism Bias]].

[[Slippery Slope]] - You say that if we allow A to happen, then Z will eventually happen too, therefore A should not happen.

[[Special Pleading]] - You move the goalposts or made up an exception when your clam was shown to be false.

[[Strawman]] - You misrepresent someone's argument to make it easier to attack.

[[The Fallacy Fallacy]] - You presume that because a claim has been poorly argued, or a fallacy has been made, that the claim itself must be wrong. 

[[The Gambler's Fallacy]] - You say that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins. 

[[The Texas Sharpshooter]] - You cherry-pick a data cluster to suit your argument, or found a pattern to fit a presumption.

[[Tu Quoque]] - You avoide having to engage with criticism by turning it back on the accuser - you answer criticism with criticism.
