## Arguments Against this being a Logical Fallacy

There is an argument to be made that the Slipper Slope Argument (SSA) is not always a logical fallacy. Depending on its use, it can be used as a logical and rational part of an argument, so the ability to distinguish which it is is important.

It is fine to say A will lead to Z but only if you make a decent case for why this would or might happen. The chain of causality needs to be explained for it to be seen as a possible argument and not merely a logical fallacy or an invalid argument.
