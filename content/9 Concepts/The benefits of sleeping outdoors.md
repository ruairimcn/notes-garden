# The Benefits
## Natural light exposure
Natural light exposure helps to reset your body clock to be more in line with your [[Circadian rhythm]]. When you wake naturally due to it getting brighter outdoors, you wake better with less grogginess. 

[[Morning sunlight wakes us up faster than afternoon sunlight]] as our brains know the difference between the two.

## Less unnatural light
Studies have shown that exposure to indoor fluorescent lighting has a negative effect on sleep quality as it suppresses [[melatonin]] which regulates sleep and wakefulness. 

## Increased immunity
Being outdoors
- Lowers [[Cortisol]] (stress hormone)
- Lowers blood pressure
- Lowers heart rate
- Boosts levels of white blood cells 
- Boosts levels of anti-cancer proteins
- Increases immune activity


## More fresh air boosts brain and body
Sleeping outside improves our ability to think as we get more oxygen outdoors. 

It also lets our bodies break down lactic acid better, so you will recover faster from early morning exercise.


## Less detrimental stale air
There is more CO2 indoors than outdoors, and CO2-dense rooms can slow our metabolism and make us feel lethargic. 


## Reduce stress
Seeing and hearing the great outdoors reduces stress levels and calms your mood.
