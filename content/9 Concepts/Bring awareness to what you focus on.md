Awareness is an important part of maximising our time and attention, and to acheiving [[Hyperfocus]].
Not everything will be worth our time and attention, but it is often our [[Hindbrain]], running on autopilot, that makes these decisions.
By using our [[Pre-frontal cortex]] and bringing awareness to decisions on how to spend our time and attention, we can make better decisions and hence better investments of our time, attention, and energy.

This can be practiced through [[Meditation]].

**Note:** I'm unsure if I've used the [[Neurology]] terms correctly here, #FurtherResearch required.
