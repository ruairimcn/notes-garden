The Yamas are the first of [[The Eight Limbs of Yoga]]. 
They describe ways in which we can control our reactions and actions. 

There are five of them:
1. **Ahisma.** 'Not injure' oneself or others. Prevent injury and sickness, learn to rest when you are overworked. 
2. **Satya.** The practice of honesty, with yourself and others.
3. **Asteya.** The practice of not stealing, not being jealous, and ceasing to compare yourself with others.
4. **Brahmacharya.** Abstinence, sometimes taken to mean celibacy. In the modern world it is often interested as '*not spending your time on things that waste your energy*', to get rid of things in your life that drain you.
5. **Aparigraha.** Non-greed, not living in excess, not falling for the trap of believing that more material goods will make you happier. 



# Similarity to Buddhism
**Ruairi:** I see parallels here with the [[Buddhism Precepts]].
