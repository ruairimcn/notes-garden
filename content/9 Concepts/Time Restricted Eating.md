Time restricted eating is the process of only consuming foods and drinks (anything but water) within a certain time period each day.

Ideally, you eat within a window of 12 hours and aim to get this down to 10 or 8 hours.
Only drink water outside of this window.
Even better - don't eat 2.5 to 3 hours before bed. 

# The Science
A study was done on rats, fed 'a standard Western diet'. One group was allowed to eat at any time, the others ony within an 8 to 10 hour window.

The unrestricted group was obese after 18 weeks, with a range of ill health effects from obesity and fatty liver, to gut and heart disease. This was while eating the exact same diet.

The restricted group were healthy. When moved to the restricted diet, the unrestricted group became healthy.

Taking a single bite of food will activate your entire digestive system, which gives this system and its organs less time to rest and recover. Even if it's healthy food, the time you eat it at can make it unhealthy overall. 

Our organs have peak performance times. Our digestive system works best with heavier/more food in the morning, and then loweritng this down as the day goes on - harder to digest food in the evening.

Doing this time restricted eating will align your eating with your [[Circadian rhythm]].
