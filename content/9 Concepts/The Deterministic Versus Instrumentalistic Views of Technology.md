For centuries, historians and philosophers have traced and debated tecnology's role in shaping civilization. 
They often fall into two camps:

# Technological Determinism
This term was dubbed by sociologist Thorstein Veblen.
- Technological progress is an autonomous force outside of man's control
- Technological progress is the primary factor influencing the course of human history.

[[Karl Marx]] spoke of this when he wrote
"The windmill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist."

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] succinctly said
"Things are in the saddle
And ride mankind."

A more extreme take on this view is that, as [[Marshal McLuhan]] wrote, humans are merely "the sex organs of the machine world"; that our purpose is to produce ever more sophisticated tools, and that once we make machines that can reproduce on their own, we will be dispensable. 

# Instrumentalism
This camp downplays the role and power of technology on human history, believing tools to be neutral artifacts, subservient to the *conscious* wishers of their users; mere means by which we achieve our ends. 
In [[The Shallows]], [[Nicholas Carr]] writes that this is the most widely held view of technology, "not least because it's the view we would prefer to be true. The idea that we're somehow controlled by our tools is anathema to most people."

Media critic James Carey wrote
"Technology is technology, it is a means for communication and transportation over space, and nothing more." 
Carr disagrees, and I do too having read his book!


Carr argues that the deterministic view holds true over the long-term (jump to [[The Shallows#^c76b4a]])
