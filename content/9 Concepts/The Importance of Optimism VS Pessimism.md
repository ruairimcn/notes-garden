# The Importance of Optimism VS Pessimism

In this note, I will set out an argument on why optimisim is important, and why the metric how many people on the planet are optimistic is as imponrtant one.


## The Case of the Struggling Business.

Imagine, if you will, a typical business; ACME Inc, 100 staff selling 'widgets'.
Things are not looking good for ACME Inc: There's a recession on the horizon, profits are at an all-time low, bad news just keeps coming.

Let's do some [[Thought Experiments]]:

Imagine the majority of staff in the business has an optimistic outlook. Let's say 95%, so 95 optimists with 5 pessimists.

They stand a better chance of success, I think (and need to back up), than a group of 95 pessimists. 



## The Survival of Humanity
I believe that how many people on the planet are optimistic VS pessmistic will be a factor in our survival.

The thoughts we think have a physical, neurological effect on our brains due to [[Neuroplasticity]]; [[The Placebo Effect]] and [[The Nocebo Effect]] are real things that can change our behaviour. 

Put another way: to an extent, what we think can become reality; as a wise person once said: 
> ðŸ’¡ If you think you can do it, you're right. If you think you can't do it, you're also right.
