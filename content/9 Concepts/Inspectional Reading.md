According to the book [[How To Read a Book]],
"Inspection reading is the art of *skimming systematically.*"
It is characterised by an emphasis on time; we give ourselves a limited window of time to figure out if it is worth reading in depth, i.e. doing an [[Analytical Reading]] of the book.

You aim to learn what the surface alone of the book can teach you - often this is a lot. 


# The Two Types of Inspectional Reading
There are two types of inspectional reading. When new to this technique, it is advised to consider them to be two separate activities, and to then perform both simultaniously as you get experience with each type.

The two types are 
[[Systematic Skimming]] - Skim the book, get the gist or main idea. Decide if you want to read it. Spend a few minutes to an hour max.
[[Superficial Reading]] - Read the book from start to finish (if you deem doing so worthy as you read on) at a quick pace, not stopping to grapple with concepts you don't yet understand.
