To support his idea that '*deep down, most people are pretty decent*', [[Rutger Bregman]] discusses a question forumlated and asked by professor of social psychology [[Tom Postmes]].

Postmes asks:

Imagine an airplane makes an emergency landing and breaks into three parts. As the cabin fills with smoke, everybody inside realises: We've got to get out of here. 
What happens?

- On Planet A, the passengers turn to their neigbours to ask if they're okay. Those needing assistance are helped out of the plane first. People are willing to give their lives, even for strangers.
- On Planet B, everyone's left to fend for themselves. Panic breaks out. There's a lot of pushing and shoving. Children, the elderly, and people with disabilities get trampled underfoot. 

**The question: Which planet do we live on?**

Postmes estimates *97% of people thing we live on Planet B*, whereas reality shows that in almost every case, *we live on Planet A.*
This answer is consistrent across economic class, political leaning, level of education and more.

This question's answer is linked to [[Veneer theory]]; the idea that civilisation and society are simply a thin veneer hiding our true nature of selfishness, aggression, and other negative traits.
