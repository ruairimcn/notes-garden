Language is not a technology; it is native to our species. Our brains and bodies evolved to hear and speak words. Just as birds learn to fly and spiders learn to weave webs without instruction, so do children learn to talk. 

Reading and writing on the other hand, are not innate to our species, though at first glance they can appear to, given how important they have become to our society and culture. They are made possible due to the purposeful development of technologies such as the alphabet. 
**Reading and writing require education and practice; the deliberate shaping of neural pathways in the brain.**
