# Design Contstraint Trade-Offs
A design constraint trade-offs are unaffected by supplementation - you can't add more resources to solve the problem, as the problem is one of design.

As an example, speed cannot be increased without sacrificing mobility; a bird cannot fly with a lot of speed and mobility; it can either be
- Fast and not agile
- In the middle; somewhat fast and somewhat agile
- Slow and agile

The other type of trade-offs are [[Allocation trade-offs]].
