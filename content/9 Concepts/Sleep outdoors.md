# Personal experience
**23rd June 2021:**
I've spent the last month working outdoors by [[Outdoor Office|Setting up an outdoor office]].
I now love working outdoors and try to spend more time outdoors in general.
I'm going to experiment with spending even more time outdoors by sleeping in a hammock (with a built-in mosquito net).
I have a normal hammock but the lack of a mosquito net makes it less than ideal to use in [[Thailand]].
So I have one with the net built-in on the way, and when it arrives I'll experiment with sleeping outdoors four to five nights a week in an effort to combat [[The Modern Problem MoC]]
