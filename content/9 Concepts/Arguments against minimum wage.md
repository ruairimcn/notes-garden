# Minimum wage leads to fewer jobs
A basic lesson of [[Economics MoC]] is that when prices go up, people buy less of that thing. This law of demand also affects the market for low-skilled labor, making workers less affordable. 

If an employer has to pay staff $15 an hour but they only bring in the business $10 an hour,they will not hire them. 

A study showed 1.4 million jobs were lost in the late 2000's when the minimum wage rose across all 50 states in the [[USA]] by an average of nearly 30%, with those losses mostly being suffered by people who needed those jobs the most.

# Minimum wage disproportionally hurts marginalized groups
The first people to be fired and the last ones to be hired are those deemed the least productive; often those with poor eduction. So they are the first to go when the minimum wage increases. 

Furthermore, a minimum wage increases competition, as those with better education, such as retirees, renter the workforce only because of the higher wage. They usually have more skills, squeeze out immigrants and undereducated people.

# Businesses do voluntarily raise wages, so a minimum wage isn't necessary to get what one deserves 

96% of American workers today (2016) earn wages higher than the current minimum wage, proving employers don't just pay the minimum wage
