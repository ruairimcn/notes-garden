# Allocation Trade-Offs
Allocation trade-offs are what people will usually assume you are talking about if you say 'trade-offs'. They are trade-offs in a zero-sum (finite) game or system, where the pie has a fixed, unchanging size, and for something to get bigger, something else must get smaller.

E.G. for a deer to get larger antlers, something else has to shrink, has to be borrowed from. 

The other type of trade-offs are [[Design constraint trade-offs]].
