# Ergonomics
Ergonomics is the process of changing your environment to make it more suited to the human body, in order to reduce potential damage that can arise.

It is of particular interest in the work environment; incorrect use of chairs, desks, montiors, keyboards, and mice, can have a negative effect on one's physical health. This is often a slow, long-term negative effect as opposed to something that arises quickly, which can make it difficult to spot.

University of Pittsburgh professor Nancy Baker says that “ergonomic” is a word that means a work station is specially fitted to the user, not a one-size fits all, out-of-the-box solution.
