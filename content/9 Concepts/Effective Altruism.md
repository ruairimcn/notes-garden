# Effective Altruism
[[Altruism]] is the giving of your resources - usually time and money - to benefit other people.
Effective Altruism is the attempt to do this as effectively as possible, as unfortunately it is possible to give your time and money in an ineffective way.

# Getting Started
Check out the charity [[GiveWell]], they research charities to find the ones who deliver the maximum impact per dollar donated.


# Arguments for Effective Altruism
Break down and see the illusion that is [[The myth of the self-made man]].
