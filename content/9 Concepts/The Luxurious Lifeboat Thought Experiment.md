Imagine the entirety of human life as people standed out at sea, with a few lifeboats around.

The Western World is a luxurious lifeboat, one that not only saves people from drowning but caters to a wide variety of indulgent needs. At the other end we have people drowning in the ocean who might not make it into a lifeboat - the poorest of the poor in Third World countrues. In the middle we have lifeboats ranging from barely functional to functional but without luxuries.

The thought experiment asks 'How fancy and luxurious should we be making our lifeboats when that money could be spent building new lifeboats?'
Or, how much money, time, and effort should we be spending on non-utilitarian (luxurious) developments when people are dying unnecessarily and suffering in extreme poverty every day?
