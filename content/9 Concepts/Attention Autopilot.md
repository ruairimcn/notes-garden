Attention Autopilot is the state of allowing our unconscious mind to control and direct our attention.
It is necessary as we don't have the time or the energy to consciously direct our attention everyday.
[[Habits]] guide us through many daily actions that no longer require our conscious attention to be successful.

# When to turn off Autopilot
Some actions and decisions are worth making deliberately, hence:

> ðŸ’¡ The key to using Attention Autopilot well is **knowing when to use autopilot and when to not use it.**

In the book [[Hyperfocus]], author [[Chris Bailey]] writes that we usually manage our attention on autopilot. 
Autopilot is usually concerned with our survival and wellbeing, but problems arise as we are no longer [[Hunter-Gatherer|Hunter-gatherer's]] living on the savannah and many things in modern life hijack this, e.g. our hunter-gatherer brains seek novelty, and digital devices overload our brains with novelty, so this is a juicy activity for a brain on autopilot.

# The Four Types of Tasks
Because [[Our minds seek novelty when it is resisting a task]], autopilot mode will usually have us doing tasks that are urgent and stimulating. The problem is that **these are usually not the most *significant* tasks that we could or should be doing.**

By understanding [[The Four Types of Tasks]] we can understand how getting our most important tasks done requires us to **consciously direct our attention.**
