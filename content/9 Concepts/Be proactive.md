**Be proactive** is the first habit of [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]].

Being proactive is the opposite of being reactive.

Reactive people think the problem is 'out there'; they blame the external world - people, situations, etc - for ther problems and failures. With little to no time spent planning, reflecting, and using their own initiative, they leave themselves unable to work in tandem with reality, and they merely react to the circumstances they end up in. 

Proactive people **recognize they have responsibility.**

Proactive people understand [[The Circles of Control, Influence, and Concern]]; they know what they can control and influence, and what they can not.

Reactive people spend too much time worrying about things in their circle of concern that they cannot control or influence. 

# Actionable Advice
1. Replace reactive language with proactive language.
2. Convert reactive tasks into proactive ones.
