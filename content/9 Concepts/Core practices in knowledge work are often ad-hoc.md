Knowledge work often involves complex unspecified tasks to be completed. Even when this work is core to the job, the work is often approached in an ad-hoc manner; on the spot, born of past experience and instinct. This is the opposite of an [[Executable strategy]].

This way of working is contingent on the practitioner and the context, so it is difficult for knowledge workers to build and share knowledge about, and create [[Executable strategy|Executable strategies]] for these practices.

With no solid ground to stand on, it is hard for knowledge workers to evaluate and develop their performance in their core tasks. This may be one answer to the question [[Why is knowledge work difficult to measure?]] and a component of why [[Most knowledge workers don't pursue improvement in fundamental skills]].

Since these work processes are ad-hoc instead of structured, the outputs themselves are often unstructured which reduces the likelihood that they will accumulate into something more valuable over time ([[Knowledge work should accrete]]).
