'Is not the [[Self]] the beginning of all disorder?'
- [[Krishnamurti]]

Even if one were to look at disorder in a physical sense, outside of the mind, it is what it is - only the human mind, a self, comes along and labels it as 'disorder'.

My interpretation of what [[Krishnamurti]] is saying is that the self, or the ego, and its incessant desire and craving to get things for **itself**, to "improve **my** lot", to "get things for **me**", is the main source of disorder in life.

I agree with this. 
Look at any animals, like ants; not one of them is selfish, not one of them is lazy, hoardes food, slacks off from work; they serve the whole. Sure, they run into problems with weather and predators, but that's not disorder so much as the Yin and Yang of nature. 

The more we loosen our egos hold on how we live and react, the more we gain control over the self and embrace unconditional love and compassion, the less disorder we will bring into the world.
