The difference between us and animals is the animals are violent as per natural selection's plan so we don't really consider it conflict, especially when compared to humans, whose conflict with the environment, other species, and each other, is a cause mass suffering to ourselves, and often leads to our destruction of much of the environment, including its animal inhabitants. 

I think it might be the case that drama and conflict are directly correlated here.
I soon after realized this was not an original thought; [[Krishnamurti]] essentially has this as his core teaching, saying that , that [[Disorder as created by the Self|the self and ego are the cause of all conflict and disorder]]

But now I also figured it out myself in a new context which will help to reinforce it in my mind. 

Consider any TV show, movie, video game, drama, musical, story, etc; if people are what make it interesting (and this is almost always the case), it is usually **conflict between people that makes it interesting.**

Reality TV shows are the ultimate example here; put a bunch of people together, and watch as the drama unfolds; usually in the form of conflict between the actors.

It has been said that most stories, at their core, are the story of Romeo and Juliet - boy meets girl and the world tries to keep them apart; this too is a story of conflict.

War and Peace, Pride and Prejudice, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Moby Dick, LÃ©s Miserables, The Lion King, Avatar, The Avengers, Titanic, Harry Potter, Othello - **conflict and drama! **
