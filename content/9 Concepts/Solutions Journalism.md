 Solutions Journalism, according to [[Tina Rosenberg]], is "looking at and covering how people are trying to solve problems".
 It's not for breaking news.
 
 # The Four Qualities of Solutions Journalism
 1. Must be about a solution to a problem
 2. Look at the evidence of success or failure
 3. Must be informational not just inspirational
 4. Has to cover the limitations of the response, this is journalism not PR 
 
 # Example
 [[Tina Rosenberg]] gives the example of wanting to do a piece on how, in many countries with high levels of AIDs, AIDs medication was too expensive for most people to buy. This was due to Pharma companies and the USA administration putting pressure on countries to not buy or produce their own generic brands of certain medicines. 
 
 She wanted to do a piece on it but her editor said no, one reason being it was 'too depressing'.
 So she re-worked it into a Solutions journalism piece by finding a country who had overcome this, and looking at how they did it. She found that this was the case in Brazil, changed the angle of the piece to cover the solution as well as the problem, and the piece was published and had a positive impact on the sitation.
 
 
 # Why
 Tina says that one reason for the success of this kind of journalism is [[People are more likely to take action if given examples of real-world solutions, not just the problem]].
