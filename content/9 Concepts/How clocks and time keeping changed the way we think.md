For most of human history, time has been experienced as a continuous flow, following the cycle of the sun and the seasons. If time was ever 'kept', it was done via instruments that used these natural cycles; sundials, hourglasses, and water clepsydras.

There was no real need to break the day up into smaller pieces or to measure time with precisions.

# Medieval Timekeeping
The medieval historian Jacjues Le Goff wrote that life was
"dominated by agrarian rhythms, free of haste, careless of exactitude, unconcerned by productivity."

[[The first clocks were assembled in monasteries]]

The rich and royal took a liking to clocks - always prizing the latest and greatest devices - and began to invest in their refinement and manufacturing. 

As people moved from agrarian work in the countryside and into indistrious tasks in the city, their days were governed by the tolling of a bell. 

In his history of timekeeping, David Landes writes
"Bells sounded for the start of work, meal breaks, end of work, closing of gates, start of market, close of market, assembly, emergencies, council meetings, end of drink service, time for street cleaning, curfew, and so on through an extraordinary variety of special peals in individual towns and cities."


# Synchronising time
At first, each town or city followed its own clock. But the need for tighter timekeeping, in order to synchronize works transport, devotion, and leisure, provided the push for rapid progress in timekeeping technology. 

Units of time became standardized in order to support the constant growth of commerce and industry.

# Personal Timekeeping
As well as becoming more accurate, **clocks also became smaller and cheaper.** Advances in miniaturization meant affordable timepieces could now fit into a person's house, and then onto their person. 

Standardized time in town and cities had a large effect, and so did the accessibility of watches to the common person.

David Landes writes that the personal clock became
"an ever-visible, ever-audible companion and monitor", continually reiminding its owner of "time used, spend, wasted, lost", becoming "prod and key to personal productivity" and a "major stimulus to the individualism that was an ever more salient aspect of Western civilization."

> ðŸ’¡ The mechanical clock changed the way we saw ourselves. And [[Our intellectual maturation can be seen in the way we draw pictures and maps|like the map]], it **changed the way we thought.**

With time defined and refined as units of equal duration, we began to see abstract patterns and and underlying order "behind the visible surfaces of the material world. The clock played a crucial role in propelling us out of the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance and then the Enlightenment." - [[The Shallows]]
