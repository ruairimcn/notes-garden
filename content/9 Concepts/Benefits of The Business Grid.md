Some benefits of [[The Business Grid]] as per the book [[The Grid]]:

1. **It allows you to think in wholes**, giving you the big picture. Helps with managing conflicting goals, trade-offs, and decision making. 
2. **It views the world as constantly in motion.** Nothing stays still in life, including business, so analyzing a business as if it stays still will cause problems. "It doesn't matter what our strengths and weaknesses are today. It matters whether they are getting stronger or weaker, and what they will look like tomorrow."
3. **It is universally applicable.** It deals with the fundamentals so it works for all kinds of businesses, as well as not-profits, governments, and individual career decisions.
4. **It can be used by teams or individuals.** "It allows for people from different disciplines to have structured conversations in language everyone understands, using a common reference point."
5. **It is complementary to existing ways of working.** It doesn't require 'formal adoption'.
