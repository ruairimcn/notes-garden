People are being paid to think. [[Indie thinkers]] spend their time asking questions, researching niche topics, connecting ideas, and share their newly acquired knowledge online for people to consume.

There are currently five main revenue streams for indie thinkers:

- Paid newsletters (Substack, Ghost)
- Private communities (Circle, Slack, Telegram)
- Online courses (Teachable, Podia)
- Sponsor0ships (Patreon, Buy Me A Coffee, Memberful)
- Consulting (SuperPeer, Houcan, MentorCruise)
    

Some indie thinkers go onto building new tools for thoughts, such as [[Andy Matuschak]] with Orbit, or Tom Critchlow and Toby Shorin with Quotebacks.
