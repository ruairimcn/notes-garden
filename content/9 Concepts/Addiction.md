# From Dopamine Nation 
In the book [[Dopamine Nation]], [[Dr. Anna Lembke]] writes that
> ðŸ’¬ 'Addiction broadly defined is the continued and compulsive consumption of a substance of behaviour (gambling, gaming, sex, drugs, etc) despite its harm to self and/or others.'

Put another way it is [[Compulsive overconsumption]].

## Addiction and dopamine
The more dopamine a behaviour or substance releases in the [[Brain|brain's]] reward pathway, and the faster it is released, the more addictive it is. This doesn't mean that substances literally contain dopamin; rather they trigger its release in our brain.

### Dopamine levels
For a rat in a box, it experiences the following increase in dopamine output:
- Chocolate 55%
- Sex 100%
- Nicotine 150%
- Cocaine 225%
- Amphetamines like meth and adder all over 1000%.

## Risk Factors
- [[Ease of access to an activity or substance is a big risk factor for addiction]]. Propagated by [[Limbic Capitalism]].
- Risk increases if a biological parent or grandparent is addicted, even if the person is raised outside the addicted home.
- Mental illness is a risk factor although the relationship is unclear; does mental illness lead to drug use or does drug use cause or unmask mental illness?
- Trauma
- Social upheaval
- Poverty
