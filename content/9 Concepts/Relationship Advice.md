# Relationship Advice
This is a #WorkInProgress 

So this is a prime example of something I didn't expect to be writing about in the near future, but it has been pulled out of me by [[Obsidian]]; that's one of the things I love about Obsidian and of this kind of note taking; it helps and inspires me to write about topics I wouldn't generally consider.

I'm going to write about relationships because I think it's a skill, one that I've gotten better at and is very important to develop. I'm no means a master but I have a great relationship with my partner who I live with so I've some tibits to share about what worked well for me.
