Traditional educators often get in the way of learning, unintentionally or otherwise, e.g. trying to hint at the right answer and not rewarding the learner if they come up with a different solution.

A [[Brain-centric Design]] educator, in contrast, acts like an orchestra conductor. Their job is to lead and teach from a big-picture, higher perspective.

They
- Need to be able to speak to each individual, no matter what instrument they play (no matter their cognitive skills and education)
- Need to create an atmosphere where there is no wrong answer or dumb question; where the learner is **willing to take risks and step outside their comfort zone.**
- Need to be flexible. Their learners will be different and they must accommodate this. Their old way of teaching might not be optimal. Their teaching materials might have room for improvement. 

This environment fast-tracks learners into adaptive experts who can embrace change and versatility, instead of stuck-in-one-way routine experts.
