Christian monks were the first people to want a more accurate measurement of time; their lives revolved around a rigorous prayer routine. 

In his book [[The Shallows]], [[Nicholas Carr]] writes
"In the sixth century, Sait Benedict had ordered his followers to hold seven prayer services at specified times during the day. Six hundred yeas later, the Cistercians gave emphasis to punctuality, dividing the day into a regimented sequence of activities and viewing any tardiness or other waste of time to be an affront to God. 

Spurred by the need for temporal exactitude, monks took the lead in pushing forward the technologies of timekeeping. It was in the monastery that the first mechanical clocks were assembled, their movements governed by the swinging of weights, and it was the bells in the church tower that first sounded the hours by which people would come to parcel out their lives.  "
