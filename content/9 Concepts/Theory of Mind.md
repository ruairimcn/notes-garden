Theory of Mind is the ability to know and understand what is in the mind of another. 
It is discussed in the book [[A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century]]. 
It is one of the abilities that we [[Humans]] have that some animals can do but that we excel at.


# Mechanics 
In the book, the authors write that for theory of mind to work, an animal needs to be able to emulate the mind of the other person in their own mind; they must have a subjective experience of both themselves and the person they wish to communicate with, and how accurate this conjured-up experience is will affect the success of the communication. 

The space in which concepts are discussed and worked upon collaboratively is called [[Shared consciousness]] in the book. Each participant has their own unique take on this space, similar to how a group of people can view an event from different vantage points and hence give a portrayal of the event that is different to everyone else's but still based around a real, physical event.

The book discusses how even the most basic forms of a shared consciousness provide a great advantage to a species, such as a pack of wolves basic ability to communicate during a hunt. 

> ðŸ’¬  Collective consciousness, an evolutionary invention unlike any other, creates cognitive emergence.


If two populations of equally smart individuals exist, where one can respond to and modify the ideas of others, and the others lack Theory of Mind and cannot conceptualize what others are thinking, the former will win in competition between each other.

# Relevant Quotes
> ðŸ’¬ We humans are by far the most aware of one anotherâ€™s thoughts of any species that has ever existed, because we alone can, if we so choose, hand over the cognitive goods explicitly and with spectacular precision. **We can accurately pass a complex abstraction from one mind to another by simply vibrating the air between us. **It is everyday magic that usually passes without our notice.


# Neurology

I think it is related to [[Mirror neurons]] which allow us to replicate the movements of other humans.
