In our personal and professional lives, good enough is often fine. None of us are or will ever be perfect, and while attention to detail and a desire to make our work great is excellent to have, there is a balance to be struck so that we don't end up becoming perfectionists.

The book [[ReWork]] suggests finding what it calls a 'judo solution' to problems: '*one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort.*'

It can be tempting to flex our intellectual muscles by concocting a complex solution, but often this is not the best approach. 

**You can usually turn *good enough* into *great* later on.**
