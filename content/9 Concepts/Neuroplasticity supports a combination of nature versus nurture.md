In [[The Shallows]], author [[Nicholas Carr]] writes that
"The plasticity of our synapses brings into harmony two philosophies of mind that have for centuries stood in conflict: empiricism (nurture, blank slate) and rationalism (nature, built-in mental template)."

Experiments on the [[Neuroplasticity]] of the Aplysia sea slug revealed that both views have merit and indeed may complement each other.

Our genes specify, at birth many of the connections among neuron. These form the 'innate mental templates' that [[Immanuel Kant]] was a supporter of.

However, it is 'our experiences that regulate the strength, or long term effectiveness, of the connections, allowing, as [[John Locke]] argued, the ongoing reshaping of the mind and the "expression of new patterns of behavior."
