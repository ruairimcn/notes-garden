In 1997, siz boys set out from the island group of Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, to the smaller island of 'Ata.
They were rescued from the island over a year later by ab Australian sea captain.

[[Rutger Bregman]], author of [[10 Literature Notes/Books/Humankind]], was able to track down and inverview one of the boys and the captain, and he uses the story as an argument against [[Veneer theory]]

# The Story
The six boys studied at a strict Anglican boarding school. The oldest was sixteen, the youngest thirteen, and they yearned for excitement and adventure. So they stole a boat from a fisherman they disliked and decided to try and make it to Fiji or New Zealand. 

They didn't prepare much: 
- Two sacks of bananas
- A few coconuts
- A small gas burner
- A knife

None of them were experiences sailors and only one knew how to steer a boat.

They fell asleep and awoke during the storm, which broke the sail and rudder.
They drifted for eight days, surviving by catching rainwater in hollowed-out coconut shells.

'Ata is considered uninhabitable.

By the time the Australian captain rescued them, they had set up a small commune with
- Food garden
- Hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater
- A makeshift weights gym and badminton court
- Chicken pens
- Permanent fire
- Makeshift guitar

All from handiwork and an old knife blade.

One boy managed to produce fire using two sticks. 
In Lord of The Flies the boys come to blows over the fire. On 'Ata, they tended the flame so that it never went out for more than a year.

They tried to make a raft to leave the island but it was destroyed by the surf. 

## Cooperation
The boys worked in teams of two and had a strict roester for garden, kitchen, and guard duty.
They volved quarrels by imposing a time-out; squabblers had to go to opposite ends of the island to cool off.

"*After four hours or so, we'd bring then back together. Then we'd say 'Okay, now apologise.' That's how we stayed friends.*"

Their days began and ended with a song and prayer.

One boy fell off a cliff and broke his leg; the others helped him back to camp and set his leg using sticks and leaves. 

## Rescue
They were rescued on 11th September 1966. They were physically fit; a physician marvelled at their muscled physiques and the perfectly healed broken neg. 


One of the boys later wrote
ðŸ’¬ *Life has taught me a great deal, including the lesson that you should always look for what is good and positive in people.*
