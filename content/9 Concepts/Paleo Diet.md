The Paleo Diet is a diet that only allows the consumption of foods we ate as hunter-gatherers.

However there is an argument to be made that, similar to how the human brain is plastic ([[Neuroplasticity]]), our digestive systems are plastic and we can adapt to eat a wide variety of food stuffs.

The bottom line, however, is that processed foods are bad and should be avoided.

# The Modern Problem
This is relevant to [[The Modern Problem MoC]]; sugar has been 'weaponised' via its addition to many types of unhealthy food, in order to make it palletable and desireable. We seek and crave sugars as in the wild as [[Hunter-Gatherer|Hunter-gatherers]], sugar was important and present in fruits, so when we found fruits we ate a lot of them to gain more energy.

Now, sugar is over-abundant and cheap, leading to a rise in health problems such as obesity.
