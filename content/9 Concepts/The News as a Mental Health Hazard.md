In [[10 Literature Notes/Books/Humankind]] by [[Rutger Bregman]], Bregman describes the news as being like a drug that is highly addictive and causes: 
- Misperception of risk
- Anxiety
- Lower mood levels
- Learned helplessness
- Contempt and hostility towards others
- Desensitization

He asks
'Would we use this drug? Would our kids be allowed to try it? Would government legalize it? To all of the above: yes. Because what I'm talking about is already one of the biggest addictions of our times. A drug we use daily, that's heavily subsidizes and is distributed to our children on a massive scale.
**That drug is the news.**'

He goes on to say that he was raised to believe the news is good for your development, important to follow to be an engaged citizen who is informed and can contribute to a healthy democracy. But scientists are uncovering more and more evidence that the news is a mental health hazard.


Researcher George Gerbner coined the term [[Mean World Synrome]] which says people who follow the news are more likely to agree with statements like 'Most people care only about themselves.'

Research has found that when immigration or violence declines, newspapers give them **more coverage.** 
They concluded that '*there seems to be none or even a negative relationship between news and reality.*'

On average we spend an hour a day consuming news - 3 years over a lifetime. 

All of this is due to [[Negativity Bias]] and [[The Availability Heuristic]].

'News is to the mind what sugar is to the body.'
