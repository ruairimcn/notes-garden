Part of the [[Brain-centric Design]] [[The Challenge Wheel|Challenge Wheel]], [[Initial Thoughts BcD]] is a one-minute phrase where learners consider their initial/prior thoughts about the subject. It prompts learners to engage their [[Pre-frontal cortex]] instead of their [[Hindbrain]].

# Activity Overview:
- Allow at least one minute
- Utilize disequilibrium
- Prime the learner for deep understanding


# Entering the first spoke
As this will be the first contact with the classroom/learners, it is important to assume they are already in a reactive fight or flight mode - 80% of sensory information is routed to the [[Hindbrain]] instead of the [[Pre-frontal cortex]], so most people aren't immediately ready to learn. The facilitator needs to power down their [[Amygdala]] and power up their [[Pre-frontal cortex]].

To do so, try activating *a moment of disequilibrium* that connects with [[The Big Idea BcD]].
E.G: Create a scenario that is meaningful for the learner (Me Here Now) as they experience a theoretical disaster by doing or saying something that is counter to the Big Idea. 

> ðŸ’¡ Disequilibrium activates neural circuitry that is associated with arousal, focus, and attention. 

Disequilibrium allows us to engage learners by setting up a scenario that will result in crisis if not managed correctly. *This leaves room for innovation and creative exploration*.

Always keep an eye out for stories and life experiences that can be used in these learning situations. Moments of disequilibrium from the real world grab people's attention.

# The Process
1. Invite learners to write down their Initial Thoughts about the Big Idea. State the Big Idea and ask them to write what they already know about it.
2. Assure them that they are the only one who will see their Initial Thoughts.
3. Allow at least one minute. 




# Benefits
Learners do the following via this exercise:
- Lean in and commit to learning
- Experience active (rather than passive) acquisition of new info
- Route info to their [[Pre-frontal cortex]] instead of their [[Amygdala]]
- Initiate metacognition
- Enter a safe learning zone
- Explore choice
- Find early success
- Prime the brain for critical thinking
- Invite them to make the content their own
- Encourage them to take responsibility for their own learning
- Establish a baseline for current knowledge of the subject



# Notes 
It's essential that each learner write down their Initial Thoughts and not merely think about them.

Fear of failure, of writing something incorrect, might hold people back from writing anything down. 
To combat this the learner must understand that
- it is a private activity 
- It will not be graded
- They will not be labeled or stratified as a result of what they write. 

**It is critical that learners are confident that you won't breach this trust.**

It may take a few cycles for learners to become comfortable. Becoming comfortable is a big step; out of the traditional model (self-judgement, punishments) and into the BcD model of promoting curiosity and agency. 

The Big Idea becomes *their* idea. 

**Priming:**
It doesn't matter if the Initial Thought is correct or not; *priming will occur anyway.*

**Pays dividends**
The small time investment spent on this priming activity pays dividends in metacognition, promoting agency, near and far transfer, and learning with understanding.

> ðŸ’¡ "For most learners, this activity is the most important minute of the entire challenge. Priming the learner by activating prior knowledge is tantamount to effective learning."

## Reminder of progress
Initial Thoughts act as a reminder of the learner's progress. They are a starting point for preconceptions. They allow the learner to see how their thinking shifts and changes over time; they can see their learning and understanding progress. 

The learner can say "I went from here to there. I get this!"
