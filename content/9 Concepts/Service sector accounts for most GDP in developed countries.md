The service sector accounts for most GDP in developed countries, measured in percentage of millions of dollars.

This change over the last 100 years to economies increasingly dominated by service industries is called [[Tertiarisation]].

# Methodology
The figures are based on nominal GDP and GDP (PPP) estimates and sector composition ratios provided by the CIA World Factbook at market or government official exchange rates with figures in trillions of United States dollars.

## Agricultural (or primary) sector
Agriculture (a term which encompasses farming) is the process of producing food, feed, fiber and other goods by the systematic raising of plants and animals. Agricultural output is a component of the GDP of a nation.

## Industrial (or secondary) sector
Industry is the segment of economy concerned with production of goods (including fuels and fertilisers). Industrial output is a component of the GDP of a nation.

## Service (or tertiary) sector
A service is the non-material equivalent of a good. Service provision is defined as an economic activity that does not result in ownership, and this is what differentiates it from providing physical goods. It is claimed to be a process that creates benefits by facilitating either a change in customers, a change in their physical possessions, or a change in their intangible assets. Service output is a component of the GDP of a nation. The service sector includes (but is not limited to) farm and factory related activities.
