**Mean World Syndrome** is a term coined by George Gerbner and discussed in the book [[10 Literature Notes/Books/Humankind]]

It causes cynicism, misanthropy, and pessimism, and states that *those who follow the news* are more likely to agree with statements like 'Most people care only about themselves.' Sufferers feel that they as individuals are helpless to improve the world, and they are more likely to be stressed ad depressed.
