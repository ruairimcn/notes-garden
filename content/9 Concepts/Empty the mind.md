Emptying one's mind, writes [[Ryan Holiday]] in [[Stillness is the Key]], is one of the ways of achieving stillness.

Some acts, some of the things we want to do, happen in such a short space of time, and require such a fast, natural, immediate response, that there is often no room to think. A good example is baseball; it takes .4 of a second for a baseball to travel from the thrower to the batter. There is simply not enough time to process this event in one's conscious mind; better to empty your mind and let your automatic responses do the work.

"Man is a thinking reed, but *his great works are done when he is not calculating and thinking.*Â '**Childlikeness**' has to be restored with long years of training in the art of self-forgetfulness. When this is attained, man thinks yet he does not think." - D.T. Suzuki, early popularizer of Buddhism in the West. 

Empty the mind of ego, of self-doubts, of overanalyzing. Don't think, **do**. Embrace the emptiness, the void, the **stillness.**

Holiday writes
"Whatever you face, whatever you're doing will require, first and foremost, that you don't defeat yourself. That you don't make it harder by overthinking, by needless doubts, or by second-guessing."

"That space between your ears - that's yours. You don't just have to control what gets in, you also have to control what goes on *in* there. You have to protect it from yourself, from your own thoughts. Not with sheer force, but rather with a kind of gentle, persistent sweeping. Be the librarian who says 'Shhh!'"

**The mind is an important and sacred place - keep it clean and clear to keep it still. **
