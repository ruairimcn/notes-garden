Alvaro Pascual-Leone, a top neurology researcher at Harvard Medical school, argues that 

> ðŸ’¡ [[Neuroplasticity]] is one of the most important products of evolution, a trait that enables the nervous system "to escape the restrictions of its own genome and this adapt to environmental pressures, physiologic changes, and experiences."

Discussing the above in his book [[The Shallows]], [[Nicholas Carr]] writes that the genius of our brain's construction is that it **does not** contain a lot of hardwiring. 

Philosopher David Buller writes that evolution 
"has not designed a brain that consists of numerous prefabricated adaptations" but rather one that able "**to adapt to local environmental demands throughout the lifetime of an individual, and sometimes within a period of days, by forming specialized structures to deal with those demands.**"

> ðŸ’¡ Evolution has given us a brian that can literally change its mind - over and over again.
