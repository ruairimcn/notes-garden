Nature versus Nurture is the ongoing debate (sometimes an argument) of whether or not the human brain is the product of :

**Nature.** That our genes shape our mental state, that we are born with a 'mental template' that determines how we perceive and react to reality. 

**Nurture.** That we are born with a 'blank slate' mind that is then shaped by our environment: culture, society, family, etc.

The prevailing scientific view is that it is a mix of both of these, though to what degree is unclear. 

Neuroplasticity supports the idea that both are involved, see
