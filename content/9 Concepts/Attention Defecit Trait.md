Attention Deficit Trait (ADT) is similar to [[ADHD]] but is **a consequence of environment, not genetics.**
I.E. ADHD is genetic and ADT arises from a natural response in our brains to 'exploding demands on our time and attention.' It is not an illness or character defect. 

**Symptoms include:**
- Distractibility
- Inner frenzy
- Impatience
- Persistent presence of panic or guilt (engaging in one thing but feeling you should be engaged in something else more important)

# Causes
[[Modern life has become hyper-novel]] so many people are constantly [[Context changing]]; this can become a habit over time and can lead to ADT; part of [[The Modern Problem MoC]]
