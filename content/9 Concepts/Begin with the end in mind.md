**Begin with the end in mind** is the second habit of [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]].

In everything you do, begin with the end in mind. Start with a clear destination. This destination may change over time but it is better to spend some time in advance planning out what it is likely to be.

>ðŸ’¬ 'It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busyness of life, to work harder and harder at climbin the ladder of success only to discover that it's leaning against the wrong wall.' - Stephen Covey

Use your self-awareness to shape your life, or someone or something else will shape it for you. 

Identify your values, as an individual or group, then you can set and achieve goals by holding them in your mind and planning a route to them. 




# Actionable Advice
1. **Visualize your funeral in detail.** Who is there? What do they say about you? How would your priorities live if you only had 30 days to live? 
2. **Take inventory of the different roles you play.** Spouse, business partner, friend, etc. Write down some goals for each.
3. **Write down what scares you.** Work out the worst-space scenario and how you would handle it.
