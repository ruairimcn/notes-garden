'[[Belief]] has no place where truth is concerned.'
- [[Krishnamurti]]

Q: What value does belief have?

Many spiritual teachers, especially Krishnamurti, say that much if not all truth must be experienced to be known as true - how else would you know it is true? Krishnamurti has said 'The explanation is not the fact.' (Related to the mental model [[The Map is Not The Territory]]). 'Therefore it is your truth, not somebody else's truth.' Related to the question asked by Jed McKenna, '[[What do I know to be true?]]'.
