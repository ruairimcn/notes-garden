Advice on working with [[The Business Grid]], from the book [[The Grid]]

# Every Box Matters
- A change in one box will result in a change in **at least one other box.**
- Don't forget or ignore any box given this fact.
- Success emerges from all nine boxes on the grid, not any small handful of them.
- The real challenge isn't analysis, it is **synthesis.**


# General Knowledge Matters
- Since every box matters, it's important to have a basic understanding of as many of them as possible.
- "*It's not how great you are at your job that defines your overall success, it's the latent impact of your expertise on the other areas of the grid.*"
- Keep the ends in mind, not just the means. This book doesn't cover the means - processes, technology, manufacturing, HR, culture, etc. Rather it gives you the framework to make decisions about what means to change, adopt, repurpose, etc. 


# This is just a template
- Don't become what the book calls a 'template zombie'; someone who is unable to stray from the template and use their own initiative.
- **The Grid is merely mental scaffolding.** Print it, write on it, discuss it with colleagues, make a decision or plan, and toss it. 
- The Grid should support your thinking, not make it rigid.
