This note will list my personal advice on how to make the best use of a gap year - a year in between leaving high school/secondary school and going into college.

For why one should consider this in the first place, see
[[College requires commitment at a time young people might be better off with freedom]]

The main thing someone wil generally want to get out of a gap year is making a good decision about what career to pursue, which often leads to making a good decision about what college course to pursue.

# Broaden your horizons
Start by slowing down and realizing that there is more to life than work and college, though these are important.
- You do have to decide on a profession/career, but this doesn't mean you have to go to college; alternatives are
	- Teaching yourself using books, internet, etc
	- Starting an apprenticeship 
	- Going straight into work
- You can always do college at a later date if you decide that this is the best decision.
- Try to balance **passion, opportunity, and competence**
	- Your work/career should be something you are *passionate* about. Don't be stuck in a job you don't enjoy.
	- Your work should bring you *opportunities* to grow, develop as a person, and earn enough money to support your desired lifestyle, save some money, and further into the future, support a family if you want to start one.
	- Your work should be something that you are competent at, or that you can see yourself being able to become competent at in the future.

#  Ask some big questions
Start by asking some big, broad questions about your life. You don't need to have answers to them straight away; just thinking about them will help.

## What do you want out of life?
What do **you** want to get out of life? As opposed to what do your parents, teachers, or other people want you to get out of it, become, or achieve. This is is your life, not theirs.

- Where do you want to live? Do you want to travel?
- When you are old and grey and in a nursing home, what do you want to be proud of having done and achieved? 
- What do you value in life? Relationships? Money? Freedom? 
- Who or what would you like to see yourself become in the future?


## What do you enjoy doing?
- What makes you excited, happy, able to bounce out of bed in the morning?
- What kind of things and activities do you enjoy doing? Look back into the past; what stands out as having been fun and interesting? What did you spend a lot of your free time doing? 
- What were your favourite subjects in school? If you didn't like any of them, that's okay!
- If you could have *any* job in the world, what would it be?
- What is the best thing you have ever done in your life? 

### Finding the common theme
A good exercise is making a list of all the things you have enjoyed doing in the past, or enjoy now, and finding what is common to all or most of them.
When I did this exercise when I was younger, my list looked like this:

- Web design
- Graphic design
- Videography
- Acting and drama
- Music and performing
- Computers and IT 

I thought about this list and over a few days worked out the common thing: **communication.** Knowing that the general area of communication was something I enjoyed and valued helped me to make decisions about my career and projects to spend my time on.


# Do some research
With the internet, you can learn about any career you could possibly want. 
Watch some YouTube videos, read some books and blogs, give yourself more information with which to make a decision.

Try to do some field/active research too; if you or your family/friends know someone in a career you are interested out, reach out to ask them some questions. People are usually very willing to talk about their work to young people so don't be afraid to ask! 


# Get real-world experience
Research online is a good start but can't beat real-world experience.

You don't need to be in school or college to do work experience, you can do it on your gap year too, and it's a very good thing to do. 

Try out some practical skills too; if you think you might like graphic design, practice drawing or making designs on a computer. If it's photography, practice taking and editing photos on your phone, or with a camera if you have one. 

The more experience the get, the better equipped you will be to make a good decision.


# Practice leaving your comfort zone
All of us have things that we are comfortable doing; these fall inside our *comfort zone.*

However, **one of the best way to grow as a person is to practice doing things outside your comfort zone.**

Also, many of the good things in life are gotten by going outside of one's comfort zone. 
If you want to win a marathon, you need to get out of your comfort zone every day and push yourself hard. 
If you want to win a photography competition, you need to step outside your comfort zone and do things you don't normally do to push and develop your skills. 

One of the best places we can be in any activity, job, or hobby, is **to know enough to be competent, but to be challenged enough to be excited.** That is, as an example, to be good enough at wood working to know the basics, but to set yourself projects that are a little above your skill level and that challenge you to become better. Such challenges, by their nature, are outside of our comfort zones, so it is only by leaving our comfort zone that we can use these challenges to grow and develop.


# Give yourself time for stillness and reflection
If you do some or all of the above suggestions, you will have added a lot of information to your brain.
In order to make the best use of this information, to turn it into knowledge and to integrate it with what is already in your brain, you need quiet time, downtime, periods of stillness, to give your brain a chance to work through all of this information.

- Get good sleep. A lot of this information integration, learning in general, and moving information from short-term storage to long-term storage, happens when you sleep. See [[How to get better sleep]] 
- Go for walks in nature. Being in nature has been shown to have many positive effects, such as reducing stress; see [[The benefits of having plants indoors]]


# Build a routine
If you can build a consistent daily routine of healthy habits, you will be in a much better position to enter college or work after your gap year.

Some suggestions are
- Try to get up and go to bed at the same time, even on weekends.
- Avoid using your phone and other devices until an hour after getting up, and 2-3 hours before bed.
- Get 30 minutes of exercise a day, ideally in the morning.
- Practice [[Meditation]] for 10 minutes a day.
- Eat clean and healthily, minimise refined sugar and processed foods.
