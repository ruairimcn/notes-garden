Our circadian rhythm is our daily, 24 cycle, or rhythm, that we go through each day.
An internal clock called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) governs many other smaller clocks in our body; there is one for our liver, gut, white adipose tissue, muscles, etc.

It is controlled by our exposure to light, specifically by cells in our retina called **photosensitive retinal ganglion cells**, that are different to the rods and cones we use to build a visual picture of reality. These cells detect the *brightness* of our surroundings.
Blue light has a much stronger effect than other wavelengths of light; this is why candles are better at night than electric lights.

As well as light, it is also affected by our physical activity, social times, and meal times.

Experiments of people kept entirely in the dark (e.g. at the bottom of a deep cave) show that our circadian rhythm will more or less keep to the same 24 hour cycle. But too much light, or light at the wrong time of day, causes a lot of problems as all our internal clocks are thrown off. This puts extrodinary strain on the body, increases our likelyhood of sucumbing to disease. 

[[Melatonin]] is a hormone that controls our sleep-wake cycle. The release of melatonin signals to our brain that it is time to sleep. Its release is suppressed by blue light, hence little to no blue light exposure before bed is great for falling to sleep easily and consistently. 

To have a good body clock is an huge positive impact on our overall health and performance.
