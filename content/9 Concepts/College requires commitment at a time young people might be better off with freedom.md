These are my own thoughts based on my own experience.
Another title for this would be "The benefit of taking a gap year."


# Summary
I think many young people are better off taking a gap before going in to college. This is where one delays going into college (usually straight from high school/second-level school) and takes a year to themselves to do whatever they want.



# Why?
College is a big commitment of time, money, and energy, generally for a minimum of three to four years.
Such a big decision, in order to be optimal, reqires

- Time, space, and stillness to think about the decision, something young people generally have not had a lot of as they have been full-time students for the last 12 to 15 years, and their free time is usually spent socializing, having fun, and generally being a care-free teenager.
- Making good decisions is largely a matter of having the knowledge and experience needed to juggle different options and outcomes. Again, young people generally don't have much of this outside of time spend in school or with friends; schools might do some form of work experience but it is usually only a handful of weeks. They often haven't been exposed to a wide-range of potential careers or areas of interest. 
- Wisdom and life experience, both of which one can get more of in a gap year where they are free to finally explore life outside of the education system.

All of the above can be gotten from a gap year. The quality of the year will vary, depending on if it's just spent having fun compared to exploring work opportunities, but even in the former case, they have at least had an extra 12 months to consider their options, and are now older and hopefully a little wiser. 

A gap year gives young people an opportunity to experience a level of freedom and self-autonomy that they likely haven't experienced beforeThis can be a welcome break having just spent anywhere from12 to 15 years in the education system. 

See [[Making the best use of a gap year]]



# Relevant reading
[[The Second Mountain]] discusses the two stages of life: maximizing freedom and opportunity, then maximizing commitment. I think that going straight into college is, for a lot of people, too quick of an entry into the second mountain, into the second stage of life.
