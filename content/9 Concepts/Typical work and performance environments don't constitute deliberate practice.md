During a soccer game, a player may only attempt to score a dozen goals; in a practice session with an expert coach, they can take hundreds of shots a day. And the coach may design those practice sessions to improve existing skills or to fix a weakness. 

The same is usually true of work; we are just trying to keep our heads above water, trying to keep our to-do lists from getting longer; we are mostly working on autopilot, which leaves no room for deliberate practice.
