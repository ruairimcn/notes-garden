# Avoid Abstractions and Illusions of Agreement
Boring reports, complex diagrams, and unreadable contracts can create the illusion of agreement; people nodding their heads when in fact no one is on the same page.

One solution is to 'get real', e.g. Airlines Alaska wanted to build a new airport; instead of blueprints and sketches they got a warehouse and built mockups using cardboard. Then they build a small prototype to test it with real passengers and employees.
"*The design that resulted from this getting-real process has significantly reduced wait times and increased agent productivity.*"

> ðŸ’¬ 'Get the chisel out and start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction. '

An antidote if you are on the receiving end is [[The Importance of Asking Questions]]
