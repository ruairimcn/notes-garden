The authors of [[A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century]] write:
'**Become skeptical of novel solutions to ancient problems**, especially when that novelty will be difficult to reverse if you change your mind later. New and audacious technologies—from experimental surgery, to the cessation of human development using hormones, to nuclear fission—may be wonderful and risk-free. But chances are, there are hidden (and not-so-hidden) costs.'

# Reasons
The book discusses the [[Omega Principle]], how both genetics and culture are responsible for helping along natural selection. As such, ancient problems often have ancient solutions in place that are likely adaptive and have helped us survive; as such we should not carelessly change or remove them.
