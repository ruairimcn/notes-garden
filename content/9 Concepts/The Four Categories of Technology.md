In his book [[The Shallows]], [[Nicholas Carr]] discusses how human technology can be roughly divided into four categories, according to the way they supplement or amplify our native capacities. 

1. **Extends our physical strength, dexterity, or other physical attributes.** Includes the plow, the sewing machine, and the fighter jet.
2. **Extends the range or sensitivity of our senses.** Includes the microscope, the amplifier, and the Geiger counter.
3. **Enables us to reshape nature to better serve our needs or desires.** Includes the reservoir, birth control pill, and GMOs.
4. **Extends or supports our mental powers.** Includes the map, clock, typewriter, globe, book, schools, computer, and the Internet.
