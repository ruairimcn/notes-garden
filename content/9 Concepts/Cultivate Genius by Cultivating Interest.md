In his essay 'The Bust Ticket Theory of Genius', [[Paul Graham]] says it might be possible to cultivate what society considers 'genius' by cultivating interest.

He argues that an obsessive interest 'is both a proxy for ability and a substitute for determination'; that wanting to explore it for the sake of it, sans determination, can be good enough.

The thinking is that those who are simply interested will explore avenues that appear to be uninteresting and are henced skipped over by those who are striving and ambitious. 

Furthermore, he thinks the ability to do this slows down with old age as people take on more responsibilities, and establish an identity, that hamper (or that they just allow to hamper them mentally) their ability to 'mess around with irrresponsible side projects the way you could when you were young and no one cared what you did.'

This is good supporting evidence for [[Follow your interests]]
