# Sleep well

- Try to go to bed and get up at th same time. We would all love to be able to sleep early on the weekdays and sleep late at the weekends but this isn't optimal for sleep. 
- Minimise light pollution by blacking out windows, keeping lights turned off, or using an eye mask.
- Minimise your exposure to blue light in the two to three hours before bed:
	- Don't use electronic devices, or if you do turn on the blue light filter/orange screen, or use blue light glasses. Or use ePaper devices like a Kindle for reading books 

[[Sleep outdoors]] to improve your sleep and general health.
