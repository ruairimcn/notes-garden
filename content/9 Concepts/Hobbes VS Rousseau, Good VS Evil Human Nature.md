The philosophers [[Thomas Hobbes]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], are frequently pitted against each other in the philosophical boxing ring, even though Hobbbes (1588-1679) died 33 years before Roussseau (1712-1778) was born.

Hobbes was a pessimist who asserted that human nature is ultimately wicked, and that civil society alone can save us from our baser instincts ([[Veneer theory]])_.

Roussea believed that human nature is ultimately good, and that it is civilization that ruins us.

**These opposing views are at the root of society's deepest divides.** The stakes are high and the ramifications of the winning side far-reaching. Harsher punishments VS better social services, reform school VS art school, top-down management VS empowered teams - many debates come down to the opposition between these two philosophers and their proposed worldviews. 

# Thomas Hobbes
Hobbes was one of the first philosophers to argue that to know ourselves, we have to understand how our ancestors lived. 
**Ruairi:** To be fair, he was disadvantages by not having as much archeology and anthropology at his disposal as modern philosophers do.

He advised that we 'Read thyself', 'thereby read and know what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the like occasions.'

He believed that in our hunter-gatherer times, we were free and therefore existed in *'a condiditon of war of all against all'*, that human life was "*solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.*"
His reasoning for this was that humans are driven by fear - fear of others, fear of death, fear of lack. That we long for safety and *"have a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death."*

He believed the solution to taming anarchy and establishing peace was for us to all give up our liberty, and to put it into the hands of an all-powerful sovereign, which he names, and has a book of the same name, the *Leviathan*. 

His thinking became the basic philosophical rationale for an argument that would be repeated millions of times by dictators, directors, govenors, and generals:
***"Give us power, or all is lost."***


# Jean-Jacques Rousseau
In contrast to Hobbes, Roussea believed that it is civil society that has caused humanity to go down a dark path - that farming, urbanisation, statehood, and private property, amongst other things, have enslaved and doomed us.

*"The first man, who, after enclosing a piece of ground, took it in his head to say 'This is mine,' and found people simple enough to believe him, was the true founder of civil society. How many crimes, how many wars, how many murders, how many misfortunes and horrors, would that man have saved the human species, wh pulling up the stakes or filling up the ditches should have cried to his fellows: Be sure not to listen to this imposter, you are lost, if you forget that the fruits of the earth belong equally to us all, and the earth itself to nobody!"*

He believed we were compassionate, healthy, and strong when we existed in a 'state of nature', and now we have become cynical, self-interested, indolent and feeble due to civilization.

His thinking and ideas imspired the phrase carried by anarchists and agitators, free spirits and firebrands:
'Give us liberty, or all is lost.'
