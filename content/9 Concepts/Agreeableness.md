Agreeableness is one of [[The Big Five Personality Traits]]. It mainfests itself in one's behaviour as kindness, sympathy, cooperativeness, warmth, and consideration.

## Business and freelancing
During my career as a [[Freelance WordPress Web Design|freelance web designer]], my high level of agreeeableness reduced my overall earnings:
- I was reluctant to tell clients that a project was going beyond its initial scope and often ended up doing work that wasn't in the initial project plan
- I sometimes didn't charge as much as I was worth

This happened as I didn't want to annoy or upset people or tell them they would have to pay extra to get something done.

I tackled this by having one of my colleagues, who was lower in agreeableness than me, deal with clients in situations where lower agreeableness was advantageous; not that we were taking advantage of clients, I just wasn't up to fighting for my own corner sometimes.
