The Uncertainty Principle in quantum physics states that one cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle.

The book [[Biocentrism]] discusses how this can also apply to typical objects in everyday life.
Consider a recording of an archery competition. 
If you pause the recording while an arrow is in motion, you know its exact position but not its momentum - its trajectory is now uncertain. To measure its position precisely is to lock it into one place, to 'pause' it. Similarly, if you unpause the recording, you cannot isolate its position. 
'*Sharpness in one parameter induces blurriness in the other.*'

# Relating to Meditation
Reading the above from Biocentrism got me thinking about how there is a relation with meditation and with observing the mind.
In the [[Meditation]] [[The Mind Illuminated]], it is said that you cannot know your current state of mind with attention alone, as attention takes a snapshot and analysis that, i.e. it cannot keep up with one's mind in realtime.
