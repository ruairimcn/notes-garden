**Adaptive experts** have a broad but deep understanding of a given area, enough that they can embrace versatility, adapt to change easily, and can work on any given part while keeping the big picture in mind. 

**Routine experts** have a narrow window of understanding, and as such are only able to conduct the 'routine' activities that they are used to. They struggle with change and are poor at being versatile.
