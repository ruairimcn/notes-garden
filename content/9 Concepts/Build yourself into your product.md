If your business becomes successful, people will eventually try to copy what you do. One way to make this difficult or impossible to do is to **make yourself part of your product or service.** Inject what is unique about you and how you thnk into what you sell. 

Zappos.com are a billion-dollar online shoe shop who have had great success thanks to their CEO's obsession with customer service:
- No customer service scripts
- No limit on how long staff can tlak wit hcustomers
- Call center and company HQ are in the same place
- All employees have to start out with four weeks answering phones and working in the warehouse
