# The Willing Suspension of Disbelief
This is where we willingly avoid thinking critically or logically about something, typically fiction, in order to enjoy it.

It is difficult to watch a movie if you are picking out every problem with it and don't 'give in' a little to the story. In the act of this 'giving in' we project 'essence of person/animal/thing' into things that are in the story; even though a movie is just lights on a screen and we know this, we still see people, places, pets, emotions, etc.
