[[Neuroplasticity]] is very powerful; there is a strong argument that [[Neuroplasticity is one of the most important products of evolution]].

In [[The Shallows]], [[Nicholas Carr]] writes that
"Although neuroplasticity provides an escape from genetic determinism, a loophole for free thought and free will, it also imposes its own form of determinism on our behavior."

As certain neural circuits strengthen from repeated actions, both mental and physical, they start to turn that activity into a habit. It's paradox is that, though it grants us much mental flexibility, it can also lock us into rigid jab it's and behaviors - existing circuits try to keep exercising and strengthening themselves.
The danger is that *neurplasticity is agnostic in regard to whether a habit is good or bad*.

Furthermore, plastic does not equate to elastic; neural circuitry is not inclined to snap back to its former state like a rubber band; it holds onto its state and strengthens itself each time it is activated. And since this mechanism is agnostic, there is no guarantee that a given circuit will be beneficial, desirable, or useful. 

These circuits were, I would argue, more likely to be good in our hunter-gatherer days, when we were in a constant challenge to survive. The modern world, with our rapidly progressing technology and our new understanding of how this can be applied to human nature and psychology, has resulted in many man-made 'hijackings' of brain circuitry; fast food, pornography, digital instant gratification, all of these are bad for us but take advantage of our innate human nature, and the more we endulge in them, the stronger these circuits become.

[[Pascual-Leone]] observed that 
> ðŸ’¬ "plastic changes may not necessarily represent a behavioral. gain for a given subject"; plasticity can be "a cause of pathology."

Neuroplasticity has been linked to mental health issues ranging from depression to OCD. The more a sufferer focuses on their symptoms, the deeper entrenched the circuits causing the symptoms are. The mind can literally train itself into sickness. 

Carr writes
"When it comes to the *quality* of our thoughts, our neurons and synapses are entirely indifferent."

Our mind will take the path of least resistance, and these are the paths in our brains that have already been created and strengthened.
