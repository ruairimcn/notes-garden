Architecture for Health and Art

# Architecture for Health and Art

I was speaking to a German man who showed me a book by a man called Christoper Day. I think it was called 'Places of the Soul'.
The book was about how architecture can be changed and improved to accommodate art and improved health of those living in or around the new structure.
	 
As an example, corners are less sharp or perfect angles, instead there is more roundness in all aspects of the building, from windows to the roof. There are more curves instead of straight lines (better for [[Acoustics]]), and this is said to look better (art) and be better for living in (health). I believe in the latter without having looked into it much as if [[The science behind the mental and physical benefits of plants|indoor plants can improve our physical and mental health]], why wouldn't less boxy architecture be better for us too? The argument being curves are found more in nature than straight lines, a supporting piece of evidence here is tha[[Fractalst
