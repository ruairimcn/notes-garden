# Digital Souls
A Digital Soul is a [[Philosophy|Philisophical]] term I've coined, meaning 
**A digital representation of a sentient being**.

These digital representations are not thought to be alive or sentient, but the fact that we somewhat project this onto them when interacting with them, typically in video games, is of  interest to me through the lens of psychology.

I believe that the same thing applies to video games: [[The Willing Suspension of Disbelief]] kicks in and we project 'essence of Goomba/Enemey Soldier/Dinosaur/Alien' into various Digital Souls.

In many video games, we then send these Digital Souls off to wage warfare in our name (your typical top-down strategy game). Or we take on a single Digital Soul ourselves in order to gun down other Digital Souls (your typical first-person shooter like Call of Duty).

I am interested in what we can learn about the human mind through studying this phenomena, which I've coined [[The Online Death Machine]]
