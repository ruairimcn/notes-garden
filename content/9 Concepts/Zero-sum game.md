A zero-sum game is a situation in [[Game theory]] and [[Economic theory]] where **an advantage that is won by one of two sides is lost by the other.**

*'If the total gains of the participants are added up, and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero.'* - [[Wikipedia]]

Dividing up a cake in which *all participants value each unit of cake equally* is an example of such a game, as are [[Poker]], [[Chess MoC]], and bridge.

The opposite is a [[Non-zero-sum game]]. A zero-sum game is *strictly competitive* whereas a [[Non-zero-sum game]] can be competitive or non-competitive.
