# The Grid
According to business book [[The Grid]], the three key goals/metrics for success in business are
1. **[[Desirability (in business)]]**. There must be people who want what you offer. 
2. **Profitability.** You must make more than you spend and be able to support your personal life.
3. **Longevity.** Your profits need to be long-term for your benefit and the business. People are reluctant to buy from a business that can't support the purchase in the future.


# Interdependence
All three of these are interdependent:
"Desirability without profitability doesn't work, and you can't have longevity without the other two."

Hence a smart business decision is one that increases all three, or if this isn't possible, it at least has an informed understanding of the trade-lfs between them. 

> ðŸ’¡ Much of the difficulty in business stems from the fact that we must constantly make decisions about these three metrics **while the world and business landscape are constantly in change.**


# Change
[[The Grid]] book combines these three goals with three broad areas of change:
1. Customers
2. Market conditions
3. The organization itself

These three goals and three areas of change are combined to create [[The Business Grid]] matrix.
