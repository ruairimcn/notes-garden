# The Online Death Machine


This is a potential name for an idea I've been pondering:

---
Every day, huge numbers of [[Digital Souls]] are killed online. I don't mean the metaphysical souls of world religions, I mean a digital representation of a sentient thing/person/being. 
Goomba's in Mario Kart, Imperial soldiers in Skyrim, troops in Risk, enemy human players in Fortnite, etc etc etc, each represents a digital soul. In games like Call of Duty you usually kill souls one at a time; in grand global strategy games like Europa Universalis 4, these digital souls are dying by the tens of thousands every few minutes.

**The Question:**
What does this say about the human mind/psyche? Maybe it says nothing of interest, maybe it does.


Is this another psychological trick of [[Mass Consumer Capitalism]] as seen in [[The Century of the Self]]? i.e. gaming is sold as being fun and being just another mass produced object for people to sink money and time to?



Is this coming from what [[Psychoanalysis]] would call an unconscious animal urge?


## Ponderings
This is essentially a swap of time and money for entertainment - why do we find the death of Digital Souls to be entertaining?

Some games have no digital souls, some have a handful, some have thousands or hundreds of thousands. Varies across games.

Sometimes there is a straight up good/bad divide in these battles/wars and players often have a choice between these. Sometimes neither is good or bad, it's just a 'Blue VS Red' fight with no clear good/bad division.
**So sometimes morality is involved, sometimes not.**

Violence can vary - from making enemies poof into a cloud of dust when you jump on them in Mario, to beating people over the head with a crowbar in Grand Theft Auto.


## How to study this further 
Read papers on the psychology of video games and violence.
