# The Grid
Desirability is one of [[The three key goals for a successful business]] as outlined in the business book [[The Grid]]. The other two are [[Profitability (in business)]] and [[Longevity (in business)]].

# Factors
The three factors that determine desirability are
- Wants and needs of the customer. If these change and your offering stays the same, desirability declines.
- The rivalry we face in the market. A competitor's success could lower your offerings desirability; a misstep could increase it. 
- The offerings our business sells. If wants and needs, and your rivals offers, stay the same, but you improve your offerings, desirability will likely increase. Offerings is used broadly here as both products and services sold, but also the customer's overall experience.
