In the book [[A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century]], the authors have an interesting definition of [[Consciousness]]:

> ðŸ’¬ Consciousness is the fraction of cognition that is packaged for exchange.


This is in contrast to our unconscious thought, which, while it effects our conscious thought, is not available for direct communication to others. 

I would go further and say it is cognition that is packaged for direct, purposeful exchange; after all, we humans are often communicating things indirectly and subconsciously vis our body language, this is a form of communication, though it is not purposefully and consciously packaged and conveyed via language.
