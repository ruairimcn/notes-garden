Incentives, generally in business, can often lead to outcomes that, while profitable in the short term, are unhealthy, undesirable, or negative.

# Reasons
Possible reasons:
- **Uncertain future of technology.** When related to technology, it is often difficult to know what the outcome of its usage will be until after it has become widely adopted, e.g. spcoa media leading to increased phone usage and mental health issues if used too much.



# Examples
- Incentives for quantity over quality often leads to reduced quality, e.g. journalism, with the knock-on effect of [[The news and media usually cover bad news]]
- Social media, app, video game, and other digital companies try to maximise the amount of time users spend on their devices/apps/services, so staff are incentivized to raise this metric.
