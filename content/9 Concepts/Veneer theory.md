Veneer theory is the idea that civilisation and society are simply a thin veneer hiding our true nature of selfishness, aggression, and other negative traits. 

It is discussed, taken apart, and critised in the book [[10 Literature Notes/Books/Humankind]].

# Propagation in the Media
In the book, author [[Rutger Bregman]] puts forth the argument that **veneer theory is pushed out and greatly amplified by the mainstream media.**
As well as having the negative effect of convincing people that [[Selfish VS Selfless Planet|we live on a planet of selfish people, not selfless people]], the media's coverage of events in a false and untrue light can often exacerbate the situation and makes it worse.

## Example: Hurricane Katrina and New Orelans
DUring the 2005 hurricane that sqept through New Orleans, 80% of homes were flooded and at least 1,836 people lost their lives.
**Newspapers were filled with untrue reports of rapes and shootings.** Many people sheltered inside the Superdome, and journalists reported two infant's trhaots had been slit and a 7 year old had been raped and murdered.

The governor of Louisiana said 'What angers me the most is that disasters like this often bring out the worst in people.'

Historian TImothy Garton Ash wrote in the Guardian 'Remove the elementary staples of organised, civilised life - food, shelter, drinkable water, minimal personal security - and we go back within hours to a Hobbesian state of nature, a ware of all against all. ...a few become temporary angels, most revet to being apes.'

Siz people died in the superdome; four of natural causes and one from suicide. The Police Chief was forced to acknowledge that not a single officially reported rape or murder could be pointed to. 

### Self-fulfilling prophecy
**All of these rumors cost lives.** Believing that looting and murder were rampant, the National Guard were mobilised, 72,000 at its peak. They opened fire on six innocent, unarmed black residents, killing a 17 year old boy and a mentally disabled man.
So, the media's reports of violence became a **self-fulfilling propehcy.**

The disaster dynamic is usually the same:
1. Disaster strikes
2. A wave of spontaneous cooperation arises
3. Authorities panic and unleash a second diesaster.


> ðŸ’¬ 'My own impression is that elite panic comes from powerful people who see all humanity in their own image. Dictators and despots, governors and generals - they all too often resort to brutal force to prevent scenarios that exist only in their own heads, on the assumption that the average Joe is ruled by self-interest, just like them.'


Veneer theory is alive and well, and the media know they can make money from it as outrage and disaster stories sell newspapers. 


# Nocebo effect
Rutger argues that our negative view of humanity is a [[The Nocebo Effect|Nocebo Effect]]:
If we *believe* people are selfish, can't be truested, etc, then we will behave and act as if it is true; a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy]] is created. You get what you expect to get.
