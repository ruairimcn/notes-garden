This is the idea that the medium in which a message, or content, is delivered, is often as important as the messages being delivered, sometimes more important.

It has ties with the idea that [[Your tools shape your thinking]]

However, this is often missed; as [[Marshal McLuhan]], who coined the term, wrote:
"The electric technology is within the gates, and we are numb, deaf, blind and mute about its encounter with the Gutenberg technology, on and through which the American way of life was formed."

In [[The Shallows]], [[Nicholas Carr]] builds on this. He writes that people naturally get caught up in the content that a new medium carries, *so much so that the medium itself falls into the background.*

(Ruairi: This ties in nicely with the [[Content and Context]] of awareness and goes even deeper; we have been inside the medium of awareness since birth!)

When debates about the medium's effects being good or bad ensue, they are usually about the *content* as opposed to the *context* or medium. 
Both matter.

> ðŸ’¬ "A popular medium mounds what we see and how we see it - and eventually, if we use it enough, it changes who we are, as individuals and as a society."

"Our focus on a medium's content can blind us to these deep effects. We're too busy being dazzled or disturbed by the programming to notice what's going on in our own heads. In the end, we come to pretend that the technology itself doesn't matter. It's how we use it that matters, we tell ourselves. The technology is just a tool, inert until we pick it up and inert again once we set it down."

# The Modern Problem
This contributes to [[The Modern Problem MoC|The Modern Problem]], our struggle to keep ourselves happy and healthy in face of all the negative ways that modern life changes our lives. 
We are often unaware of the negative sides of a medium, one such negative is that the internet medium is now the 'attack vector' for many modern problems; social media, fast food ordering, instant gratification from videos, music, and games, etc.
