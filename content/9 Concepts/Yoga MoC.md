Yoga is, in my mind, a combination of meditation, exercise, and stretching, that can have positive mental, physical, and spiritual outcomes.

I've started practicing it daily and am finding it good so far, will report back with further info after doing it for longer.

Most of my notes on yoga are currently from these two books:

1. [[Yoga for Beginners]]
2. [[The Science of Yoga]]

# Practices

## Breathing
[[Nadi shodhana breathing]]
