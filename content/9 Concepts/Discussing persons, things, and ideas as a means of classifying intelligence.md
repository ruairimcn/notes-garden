The English historian Henry Thomas Buckle famously remarked: 

“Men and women range themselves into three classes or orders of intelligence; you can tell the lowest class by their habit of always talking about *persons*; the next by the fact that their habit is always to converse about *things*; the highest, by their preference for the discussion of *ideas*.”
(Italics in original)
