Also called *escalation of commitment,* the sunk cost fallacy 
'is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from a decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the behavior instead of altering course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.' (Wikipedia)
