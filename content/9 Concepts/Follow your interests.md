I have found that the principle of following my interests has served me very well in life, in many domains:

- **Reading.** I don't worry about finshing a book before starting a new one; if I am in the middle of a book, but my interest on a given day changes to something else, I will switch to a different book for a while. This lets me read more books than I would if I only moved on to a book after finishing my current one.
