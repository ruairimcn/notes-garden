The ability to name something can give you more power over it, by allowing you to notice it, name it, and understand it.

As an example, four of the basic principles of good design (see [[CRAP Design]]) are
- Contrast
- Repetition
- Alignment
- Proximity

By understanding these principles and getting some experience with them, I gain power over them.

As an example my critique of a friend's charity bake sale poster can go from

"There's something just not right about the design... it's a little too squished together, there's not enough space. Everything looks the same."

to

"The use of alignment and proximity could be better. The date, time, and location should be grouped together and hence in closer proximity to each other. Same with the email and phone number. There is a mix of alignments too, it would look better if everything was left-aligned. And the title should contrast more against those two groups of elements to make it stand out more; try changing the font to something bolder and larger. "
