This is a [[Cognitive Biases|Cognitive Bias]] where too much favour or emphasis is given to the survivors, or winners, in a group.

An example is when the RAF asked mathematician Ambraham Wald find the areas most often hit by bullets on their planes so they could cover those areas with armors. Instead of recommending counting the holes and covering the most-hit areas, he recommended armoring the areas where none of the planes had taken any hits, as these were the places the lost planes were hit, and hence would be more vulnerable.
