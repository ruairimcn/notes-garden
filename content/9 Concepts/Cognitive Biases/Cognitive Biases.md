Cognitive Biases are rational errors made by humans when it comes to decision making, judgement, and other products of thoughts.

According to Wikipedia:
*A **cognitive bias** is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own "subjective reality" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behaviour in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called [[irrationality]].*

#ToDo: Explore the link between cognitive biases, specifically how each individual constructs their own reality, and whether or not these are decreased as one progresses along [[The Path of Insight]]

## List of Cognitive Biases
An incomplete list (unsure if there is an agreed-upon final list) mostly referenced from 
https://yourbias.is/

[[Anchoring]] - The first thing you judge influences your judgement of all that follows.

[[Belief Bias]] - If a conclusion supports your existing beliefs, you'll rationalise anything that supports it.

[[Confirmation Bias]] - You favour things that confirm your existing beliefs.

[[Declinism]] - You remember the past as better than it was, and expect the future to be worse than it likely will be.

[[Fundamental Attribution Error]] - You judge others on their character, but yourself on the situation.

[[Groupthink]] - You let the social dynamics of a group situation override the best outcomes.

[[In-Group Bias]] - You unfairly favor those who belong to your group.

[[Just-world Hypothesis]] - Your preference for justice makes you presume it exists.

[[Negativity Bias]] - You allow negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.

[[Optimism Bias]] - You overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes.

[[Pessimism Bias]] - You overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes.

[[Reactance]] - You'd rather do the opposite of what someone is trying to make you do

[[Self-serving Bias]] - You beleive your failures are due to external factors, yet beleive you're rersponsible for your successes.

[[Substitution bias]] - You are asked a question and replace the question in your mind with one that is easier to answer.

[[Survivor Bias]] - Placing too much emphasis into the survivors of a group.

[[The Availability Heuristic]] - Your judgements are influenced by the most easily/readily accessible info you already have.

[[The Backfire Effect]] - When some aspect of your core beliefs is challenged, it can cause you to believe even more strongly.

[[The Barnum Effect]] - You see personal specifics in vague statements by filling in the gaps.

[[The Bystander Effect]] - You presume someone else is going to do something in an emergency situation.

[[The Convenience Bias]] - You presume that increased convenience leads to increased productivity, and this is often not true.

[[The Inverse-Bystander Effect]] - Additional bystanders lead to more people helping if the emergency is life-threatening and if the bystanders can communicate.

[[The Curse of Knowledge]] - Once you understand something you presume it to be obvious to everyone. 

[[The Dunning-Kruger Effect]] - The more you know, the less confident you're likely to be.

[[The feature-positive effect]] - The ease of retrieveability of information causes us to overstate its importance.

[[The Framing Effect]] - You allow yourself to be unduly influenced by context and delivery.

[[The Halo Effect]] - How much you like someone, or how attractive they are, influences your other judgements of them.

[[The illusion of explanatory depth]] - people overestimate their understanding of complicated phenomena. 

[[The Intentional Fallacy]] - You assume you can know the contents of an author's mind by reading their works.

[[The Mere-exposure Effect]] - Doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it. 

[[The Nocebo Effect]]

[[The Placebo Effect]] - If you believe you're taking medicine it can sometimes 'work' even if it's fake.

[[The Spotlight Effect]] - You overestimate how much people notice how you look and act.

[[The Status Quo Bias]] - We fall back into doing work or an activity from an old role/period because we are used to it. This is exacerbated by being known amongst others foing being good at this previous work.

[[The Sunk Cost Fallacy]] - You irrationally cling to things that have already cost you something (typically money or time).

[[The X Must Equal Y Effect]] - a possible cognitive bias [[Ruairi McNicholas|I]] am investigating, where people assume that an outcome must have an equal input, but this is not always true. ^d4534a
