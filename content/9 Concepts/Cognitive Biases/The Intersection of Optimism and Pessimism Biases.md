[[Pessimism Bias]] tells us that we overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes, and [[Optimism Bias]] tells us that we overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes.

How do the two interact? What happens at the intersection? Do they cancel out to neutrality in the long term, or close to it? In what scenario does one take effect and not the other, and how does this differ across individuals, groups, etc?
