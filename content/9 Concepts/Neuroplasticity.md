The meaning of 'brain plasticity', or of the [[Brain]] 'being plastic', means that it is shapeable, mouldable like plastic or putty.

[[Andrew Huberman]] describes it as the nervous systems ability to change in response to experience. He says *nervous system* and not merely *brain* because many skills and abilities require a motor component, movement of the body.

This is due to how neurons work in the brain; how they can change shape and size, grow and prune connections, strengthen or weaken existing connections, all within a huge network containing billions of neurons. 

## Andrew Huberman
Huberman points out that no other organ in the body rewires itself to be better.

Neuroplasticity can be adaptive or maladaptive (in response to bad events and good events)

Neurplasticity can be active or passive; when under 25 it can be active or passive (mere exposure), over 25 it must be active (intentional, active pursuit of knowledge and change) (give or take, not a strict cutoff point).

**To learn as adults we must be alert and focused in order to rewire the brain.** The actual rewiring of neural connections occurs during sleep, you 'grab more *neural* (as opposed to physical) repetitions during sleep'.

## The Shallows
[[The Shallows]] by [[Nicholas Carr]] discusses brain plasticity and how it is a key factor in how the brain is changed by internet usage.

All of our neural circuits - be they for thinking, feeling, hearing, learning, remembering - are subject to change.
This plasticity diminishes as we get older but it never goes away. Our neurons are constantly breaking exisiting connections and creating new ones.

Every time we perform a task or experience a physical or mental sensation, a group of neurons in our brains is activated. If they're in proximity, they join together. As the same experience is repeated, the synaptic links between the neurons grow stronger and more plentiful through both psysiological changes (release of high concentration of neurotransmitters),  and anatomical ones (generation of new neurons).
Synaptic links can also weaken in response to stimulus. 

This plasticity brings into harmony the [[Nature versus Nurture]] argument of human behavior. 

If a person becomes blind, the parts of the brain that had been dedicated to processing visual stimuli don't just turn off; they are quickly repurposed into circuits for audio processing. 

"Neurons seem to 'want' to receive input. Wen their usual input disappears, they start responding to the next best thing." - Nancy Kanwisher, MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research.

Carr discusses how [[Neuroplasticity is one of the most important products of evolution]].


### Background and history
For hundreds of years, well into the late 1800's, most biologists and neurobiologists believed that the adult brain never changed, that our brains were malleable in childhood but not beyond it; like a concrete moulde. 
A few biologists and psychologists were starting to see indications in the rapidly growing brain research that even the adult brain is malleable. 

"Flowing water hollows out a channel for itself which grows broader and deeper; and when it later flows again, it follows the path traced by itself before. Just so, the impressions of outer objects fashion for themselves more and more appropriate paths in the nervous system, and these vital paths secur under similar external stimulation, even if they have been interrupted for some time. " - French scientist LÃ©on Dumont. 

Such speculations were dismissed. 

The idea of the adult brain grew out of, and was supported by an Industrial age metaphor that represented the brain as a mechanical contraption. 
"Like a steam engine or an electric dynamo, the nervous system was made up of many parts, and each had a specific and set purpose that contributed in some essential way to the successful operation of the whole. The parts could not change, in shape or function, because that would lead, immediately and inexorably, to the breakdown of the machine." ^357e37

[[The human desire to compare ourselves to machines]] often causes us to make incorrect assumptions about the brain, in this case about how malleable or plastic it really is.

According to research psychiatrist Norman Doidge, this view of the unchangeable adult brain turned into something of a 'neurological nihilism'; because it was viewed as fixed, it created 'a sense that treatment for many brain problems was ineffective or unwarranted.' It left those with mental illness or brain damage little hope of treatment. 


Michael Merzenich made headway into brain plasticity by severing the sensory nerves in the hands of monkeys, then mapped their brains directly after and a few months after. He found that the neural pathway's in the monkey's brain reorganize to adapt to the new, healed nerves that have regrown in the monkey's hands. At first dismissed, his work began to receive serious notice and set off a wholesale reevaluation of accepted theories about how our brains work. 

The evidence for plasticity has strengthened as science continues to advance, and all confirm Merzenich's theory.

"*Neurons that fire together wire together.*" - Donald Herb

In Hebb's studies, rats living for weeks in an environment filled with toys that were changed daily, in a large and comple living space, showed increased thickness of cerebral cortical areas - true even of aging rats. There was increased dendritic branching compared to normal laboratory cages. 

Intelligence can decrease; stress can cause neuronal degradation via dentridic arborization being curtailed and pruned.
