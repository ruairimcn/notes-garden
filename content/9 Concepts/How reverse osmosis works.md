# How reverse osmosis works

A 'sheet' or 'membrane' made up of three smaller sheets; one of these sheets, the barrier layer, removes nutrients, chemicals, and bacteria from water.  

This sheet is wrapped up into a tube. Feed/uncleaned water goes in one end, and clean water ('permeate') comes out the other side.

This process produces 'concentrate' which can be purified into further clean water, but eventually untreatable concentrate is left over. This is a waste by-product and is a disadvantage of reverse osmosis as it can pollute groundwater and hence needs to be disposed of carefully.
