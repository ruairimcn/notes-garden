The rules of [[Analytical Reading]] are as follows.
Stage 1 involves figuring out the overall meaning and structure.
Stage 2 involves correctly interpreting the authors message.

We're language a "pure and perfect medium", these two steps would not be needed. Alas, we must make the best use of language as it is; where words can vary widely in their meaning 

# Stage 1
1. Classify the book by category and subject matter
2. State what the whole book is about concisely
3. Outline its major parts
4. Define the questions and problems the author confronts

## Rule 1: You must know what kind of book you are reading.

You should know this as early on as possible, ideally before beginning to read.


## What's in a name?
We can glean something from a book by its name, e.g. 
"The Origin of Species" (real name)
VS
"The Origin of the Species" (assumed name often)

## Type, category
Is it a fiction book or an expository work?
If expository, what branch of knowledge? 
History, philosophy, science, mathematics?


## Practical VS Theoretical Books
**Practical books** teach you *how* to do something; they provide knowledge but also explain what to do with it if you wish to achieve a certain outcome.

Books that can be called 'moral' are considered practical books, as they are advising on a particular way of behaving and being in the world (practical), and there is no precise definition of right and wrong.

**Theoretical books** teach you *that* something is the case. This doesn't mean that what is taught doesn't have practical applications or utility, but often just that the author is limiting themselves to one kind of teaching, of the knowledge itself. 


Some books on the same topic (e.g. economics) can fall in to one or both categories depending on what they discuss; books on the mathematics of economics or statistical studies of economic behavior are theoretical, books on how to organise our economic lives are practical.  




## Rule 2: State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences.

Say what it is about as briefly as possible - what is its main theme or point?

Do not be satisfied with having a 'feeling' of what a. ook is about; you should be able to state it clearly. 

If it requires many sentences, you have only seen the many parts, not the unity.

These summaries will be unique for each reader, but they can still vary in how brief, accurate, and comprehensive they are.


## Rule 3: Set out the major parts of the book and show how they comprise the whole

To understand a book, we must understand both
- How it is one, single thing (rule 2).
- The parts that make it up - how it is many.


This is best done by creating an outline of the book.

It is up to you how deep the outline goes; you will not desire to give each book the same amount of attention and effort, and some books are worth more or less outlining effort than others. The books complexity will also be a factor. 

You do not have to follow the author's chapter structure in your outline; the author made this in order to write well, the one that helps you in particular to read well may not be the same. 
You can also outline books based around its main ideas, arguments, etc, as opposed to chapters.

This will give you an idea as to the quality of the book; if it is poorly written and structured, you wll not be ale to discern a good, logical structure. 


## Rule 4: Find out what the authors problems and questions were

What questions did the author set out to answer? What problems did they set out to solve? 

Do they ask practical or theoretical questions?


# Stage 2

## Rule 5: Find the important words and through them come to terms with the author

Relevant to this is the difference between [[Words VS Terms]].

**Steps:**
1. Locate the important words that support the author's argument.
2. Determine the meaning of these words: how they are used as precise terms.
