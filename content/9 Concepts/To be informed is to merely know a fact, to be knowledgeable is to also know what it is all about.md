This note looks at the difference between informed and knowledgeable/enlightened.

# How to Read a Book
[[How To Read a Book]] describes this as follows:
"To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about: why it is the case, what its connections are with other facts, in what respects it is the same, in what respects it is different, and so forth."

Related is being able to merely remember something compared to being able to explained it. 

> ðŸ’¡ "Enlightenment is achieved only when, in addition to knowing what an author says, you know what he means and why he says it."
