There is a massive over abundance of inputs available to us humans. With smartphones in our pockets, wireless internet blanketing the planet, billions of social media accounts and a 24/7 cycle of breaking news, inputs vie for our attention from all angles.

Limiting these inputs helps us to be still, spend our time better, and to better work towards our goals by only allowing inputs that will hep them.

In this note I will compile advice on how to do this from various authors, teachers, and philosophers.


# Stillness is the Key
In [[Stillness is the Key]], [[Ryan Holiday]] writes about how, as a general, [[Napoleon]] built a habit of delaying responding to the mail., instructing his secretary to wait three weeks before opening any mail. He loved to note how supposedly 'important' issues had resolved themselves and didn't need a reply.

He was not out of touch with his military or government, but he knew that to be active and aware of what mattered, he had to be selective about what information went into his brain. 

He instructed messengers to never wake him with *good news*, as that could wait - only bad news was to be brought to him immediately. 

Holiday writes
"There is way too much coming at us. In order to think clearly, it is essential that each of us figures out how to filter out the inconsequential from the essential. It's not enough to be inclined towards deep thought and sober analysis; a leader must create time and space for it. "

We cannot think or act clearly if we are drowning in information. 

Often, the first thing a great chief of staff will do - be it for a general, president, or CEO of a bank - is **limit the number of people who have access to the boss.** They become gatekeepers; guardians of the bosses time and space to think and see the big picture.

**Garbage in, garbage out.**
