[[Working memory]] is important for many tasks, including communication. [[Multitasking]] lowers our working memory.
With a reduced working memory we 
- Communicate poorly with others as we can't remember enough or all of what they have said 
- Speak, tell stories, and present poorly as we can't hold as much of the specifics, or how they relate to the whole, in our minds
- Can't keep the bigger picture in mind in any kind of work or understanding; studying in school, solving problems and complex tasks, etc. We won't understand the world as well **as our ability to hold and therefore connect puzzle pieces in our mind is reduced**
