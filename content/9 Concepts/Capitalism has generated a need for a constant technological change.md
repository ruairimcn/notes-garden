# From World-Systems Analysis
[[World-Systems Analysis]] defines [[Capitalism]] as 'a historical system defined by the priority of the endless accumulation of capital.'

In order for this to happen, a constant expansion of technological change is needed, and the expansion of  frontiers is needed, primarily in the areas of 
- [[Geography]]
- [[Psychology]]
- [[Science]]
- Intellectualism

In [[How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio]], the mos predictable force driving the economy is [[Productivity]]; a major way that producivity increases is through the discovery and implementation of new forms of technology.

As such, capitalism creates a need for technology to constantly improve.
