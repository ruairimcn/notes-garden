# As individuals
As children, our first drawings are of what we see - literal copies of what we see through our senses. Picture a typical drawing a child might make; a yellow circle in the corner is the sun, a green squiggle along the middle is the horizon. 

As we grow and mature, our drawings become both abstract and more accurate. As [[Nicholas Carr]] writes in [[The Shallows]], "we progress from drawing what we see to drawing what we know." As young adults, our analysis of experience becomes more abstract and objective. 

Cartographer Vincent Virgo writes about drawing maps in early childhood being similar to the general stages of childhood cognitive development:
"First, perceptions and representational abilities are not matched; only the simplest topographical relationships are presented, without regard for perspective or distances. Then an intellectual 'realism' evolves, one that depicts everything known with burgeoning proportional relationships. And finally, a visual 'realism' appears, employing scientific calculations to achieve it."



# As a species
This process of intellectual maturation also mimics the entire human history of mapmaking. Our early sketches in the dirt or into stone were as basic as the scribbles of toddlers.

Over time, our drawings became more realistic, outlining proportions of space, then becoming more realistic in their precision and abstraction. 

We then invented complex tools to improve our mapmaking further, such as the compass and theodolite (surveying instrument with a rotating telescope for measuring angles).

Then, maps evolved beyond merely representing regions of the Earth to becoming tools for expressing ideas, such as battle plans and urban development plans.Â 

Virgo writes
"The intellectual process of transforming experience *in* space to abstraction *of* space is a revolution in modes of thinking."


# Improving our thinking 
Maps didn't just mirror the development of human intellect; they also helped to advance and propagate the intellectual advances they documented; they embody a particular way of seeing and thinking about the world. 

> ðŸ’¡ Maps helped to "advance the evolution of abstract thinking" throughout society. 

Carr writes 
"The technology of the map gave to man a new and more comprehending mind, better able to understand the unseen forces that shape his surroundings and his existence."

Cartographic historian Arthur Robinson writes
"The use of a reduced, substitute space for that of reality, is an impressive act in itself. The combination of the reduction of reality and the construct of an analogical space is an attainment in abstract thinking of a very high order indeed, for one is able to discover structures that would remain unknown if not mapped."

Thinking of this last line, I suppose the shape of any country or continent would remain unknown if we never mapped it!
