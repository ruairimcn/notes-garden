**Links:** [[Self-improvement]]
This is a principle whereby I invest in myself first, in the form of knowledge, workshops, online lessons, etc, as opposed to investing time and money in external things like stock markets.

I got this idea from somewhere else, I think in [[Tribe of Mentors]] by [[Tim Ferriss]], I'll find out and link it back here.

# Typical things I invest time and money in
- Books, both physical and digital
- My [[Second brain]] via [[Obsidian]]
- Learning, upskilling, and educating myself in general
- High quality, high performance technology such as my Macbook Pro and iPad air. 
- Ergonomic equipment: [[Vertical mouse]], [[Standing desk]], [[Ergonomic keyboard]]
