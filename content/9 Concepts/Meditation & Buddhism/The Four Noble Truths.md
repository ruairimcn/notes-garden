The Four Noble Truths are often regarded as the Buddha's main teachings as they are thought to be the first thing he taught.

[According to WikiPedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths)
*They are traditionally identified as the first teaching given by the Buddha,[\[note 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths#cite_note-Moksha-17) and considered one of the most important teachings in Buddhism*

The Four Noble Truths are:
1) [[There is suffering or dissatisfactoriness]]
2) [[There is the cause of suffering]]
3) [[There is the end of suffering]]
4) [[There is the path that leads to the end of suffering]]



## Overview

### [[There is suffering or dissatisfactoriness]]
Buddhism says that 'Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional.'
As mortal human beings, pain is indeed inevitable - sickness, ageing, and death await us all. But **the amount of suffering that this pain causes us can be lowered.** 
Learn more through one of [[The Three Characteristics]] that links in with this Truth: [[Dissatisfactoriness]]

### [[There is the cause of suffering]]
We humans mostly suffer because of the way we interpret reality.
Primarily, we try to grasp onto things in the outside material world, wanting them to be permanent sources of happiness, when in fact all things, including both the material objects themselves and our feelings of happiness, are impermanent - see [[Impermanence]].

The link to [[Evolutionary Psychology]] is that it was beneficial for organisms to pursue things in the outside world - in fact this is the basic tool of survival, the ability (and desire) to pursue food, water, shelter, and mates, all in the service of propagating our genes. We are stuck on [[The Hedonic Treadmill]].

### [[There is the end of suffering]]
Good news - this suffering can come to an end! Or at the least it can be reduced, either a little or significantly depending on how much time and effort you commit to [[The Spiritual Path]].

### [[There is the path that leads to the end of suffering]]
We humans can reduce our suffering (and outright eliminate it through [[Awakening]]). According to the [[Buddha]], this is best done by following [[The Eightfold Path]].



### The Four Noble Truths and Natural Selection
I am a big fan of studying the intersection between [[Buddhism]], [[Meditation]], and [[Evolutionary Psychology]] (So much so that I should probably have one Note just for this! Good thing it's easy to link notes with [[Obsidian]]... [[Meditation, Buddhism, and Evolutionary Psychology]])

The Truths look like this through the lens of evolution and natural selection:
[[We don't see reality as it really is.]] 
Our senses take a huge amount of input from the 'outside' world and this is constructed into a pretty good approximation of reality in our conscious mind. It's sort of like a computer building our own Virtual Reality world inside each of our heads.
Some parts of this Virtual Reality are not true, because evolution, as it does, insteas built a brain that will see things incorrectly **if it provides a benefit to the organisms ability to survive.** My go-to example here is [[The cockroach example 1]].
