A Sangha traditionally meant a monastic. immunity of [[9 Concepts/Meditation & Buddhism/Buddhist Monks]] who have dedicated their lives to studying and practicing [[The Dharma]].

In the West, it has come to mean any community or group of people who come together to study and practice [[The Dharma]] and to build their [[Meditation]] practice.

As with many things in life, various tasks, skills, and paths can be much easier to follow if you are part of a close, trusted community of people. 'No man is an island' as they say (or woman!), and while it may be possible to walk [[The Spiritual Path]] by yourself, I'm of the opinion that it's better to be part of a Sangha.

My own Sangha is my [[TMI Study Group]].
