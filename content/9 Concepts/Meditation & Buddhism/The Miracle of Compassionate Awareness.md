The Miracle of Compassionate Awareness is the working title of a note pondering why awareness is compassionate as opposed to other ways of being, e.g. dispassionate and nihilistic.  

When one practices [[Meditation]] and works their way along [[The Path of Insight]], they will

- Dispell the illusion that they have no unchanging, permanent 'self'
- Dispell the illusion that anything at all is permanent and come to see there is only ever-changing process
- Dispell the illusion that any permanent desire can be gotten externally through the self, and learns that all desires are vectors for suffering
- Go through [[The Dark Night of The Soul]], a part of [[The Path of Insight]] that often comes with aches and pains, feelings of disgust and anguish, and other not-so-nice states


I think it is easy to look at all of this, to how the mind changes via meditation, and think it possible that the awarness found underneath all of our thoughts could just be 'nothing', or 'neutral', or even have a 'negative' tint on it - after all who would be pleased to learn that their identity is a complete illusion, nothing is permanent, and most of us are completely lost in a sense of self that generates huge amounts of discontent and disorder?

However, what we find is an awareness that is 
- Wholesome
- Compassionate
- Peaceful
- Equanimous


## The Question: Why is this the case?
