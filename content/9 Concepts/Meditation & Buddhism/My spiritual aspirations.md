# My spiritual aspirations
This note is my personal response to the teaching in [[10 Literature Notes/Books/The Way of Liberation]] of [[Clarify Your Aspiration]]

**My aspiration is to be a being who increases happiness, joy, and contentment, and reduces needless suffering, for as many beings as possible.**

I also aspire to improve/update my aspiration as I progress along [[The Spiritual Path]].

I aspire to move closer to Truth and Reality, and away from illusions and delusions, as I believe these are responsible for much of the needless suffering that I am seeking to help people dispel. 

The better I can be as a human being, the better progress I can make on my aspiration, hence I aspire to always improve and grow. 


## Why?
Why do I aspire to the above?

One reason is I am quite content already. My ideals from youth of becoming a millionaire or billionaire entrepreneur are now gone. While I do crave money and objects on some level, this is much lower than it used to be and is going lower over time. I am more generous with my time and money than I used to be. 

Meditation has increased the amount of time I spend in a calm, centered, peaceful state. Being in this state lowers the amount of craving that I do; craving takes up time and mental space.

The above means that I have more mental space to think about helping others.

I also, on a selfish level, get pleasure from helping others - a good selfish pleasure at least! I especially enjoy passing on my knowledge of business and freelancing to other young people who aspire to be freelancers. 


# Good aspiration from Adya
[[Adyashanti]] says the following in [[The Direct Path]], and while I know it's important for me to have my own thought-through and felt aspirations, I really like this:
'*These practices are meant to be one part - although a powerful and important part - of a comprehensive devotion to truth, love, and wisdom grounded in a moral and ethical landscape of selfless commitment to the welfare of all beings and undertaken in a spirit of appreciation for the great mystery of Being.*'
