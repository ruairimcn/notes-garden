# WL Never Abdicate Your Authority
The third of [[The Five Foundations of Liberation]] from the book [[The Way of Liberation]].

To never abdicate your authority is to '*take full responsibility for your life and never forfeit it over to someone else.*'
This includes spiritual teachers - an easy trap to fall into given the human desire to project unresolved issues onto others. 
Being open to guidance from a teacher is one thing, abdicating your authority to them and seeing them as a God/Divine figure is another and is not good. 

**The same applies to spiritual teachings.** They are merely signposts pointing to Reality, they are **not** Reality itself.
