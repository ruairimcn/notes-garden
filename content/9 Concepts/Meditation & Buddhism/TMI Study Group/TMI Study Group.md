**Links:** [[The Mind Illuminated]]

This page will be kept up to date with information on The Mind Illuminated Discord study group.

## Summary
As I work through and practice the material in The Mind Illuminated (TMI), I've had the great pleasure of introducing other people to its teachings. This group will allow me to give advice on the book to people in one central location, instead of dispensing the same advice to individual people. 

The purpose of the Study Group is:
- **Provide accountability:** Meditation is difficult to practice every day! And its benefits really start to snowball only if you're doing it daily. By meeting weekly and sharing our intended meditation routines with each other, we can provide accountability and help one another to practice daily.
- **Ask and answer questions:** As we will all be at different stages in our practice, those of us who are further ahead can answer questions for others. The Mind Illuminasted is quite detailed and nuanced, so it can be very helpful to discuss the content together. *But it's important that anyone who teaches only teaches from their experience.* We will be clear as to whether what we're explaining is something we read in the book, or something we have direct experience of. 
- **Get that feel of community spirit:** The [[Threefold Refuge]] in Buddhism is a set of three things (called Jewels or Jems) that help us to practice meditation and Buddhism. They are The Buddha, The Dharma (his teachings), and The Sangha (a group of practitioners). A Sangha is traditionally a monastic order, however here in the West we can use this to mean a community of dedicated practitioners. This Study Group can act as a Sangha, which will make our practice easier as we can explore this often complex and winding path as a supportive group instead of as isolated individual. 

> ðŸ’¡ There is no pressure to talk or share your experience, members are more than welcome to just listen in on the calls. 



## Meetups
The current plan is to meet for 30 to 45 minutes on Discord each weekend, options are likely to be
- 10am or 12pm GMT Saturday
- 10am or 12pm GMT Sunday

We will have a Poll each week to see what day and time suits the most people.



## Members and Privacy
The group will be kept small initially, with a cap of maybe 8 to 10 people for now.
The Discord server is private; only I can add new people, and they must be manually assigned the 'Member' role to read any past messages. The space will be kept private like this, as meditation and the experiences it brings on can often be deep and personal, and I want it to be a place where people can comfortably share their experience with one another.
