# Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha
Below are my notes on Training in Morality as explained by [[Daniel Ingram]] in [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]]

Daniel takes the domain of this training to be all the physical, verbal, and mental behaviors belonging to every single aspect of life that is not explicitly meditative:
- Trying to live a good live in the conventional sense
- Improving our physical, emotional, and mental health
- Philososphising 
- Taking care of others
- Guarding the environement
- Anything we thing will be of some benefit to others and ourselves


Daniel notes that the meaning of 'a life well lived' is different for each person.
He says it is not that we shouldn't enjoy our lives, but that plenty of the paths people go down seeking enjoyment will predictably lead to more suffering than pleasure or fulfillment.

Therefore, with these qualifiers in mind, ponder* what a life well-lived would mean and aspire to that.

Daniel calls morality 'the first and last training' because there are limits to [[Training in Wisdom]]; the path of wisdom and insight eventually reaches a terminus (with [[Nirvana]] I think?), whereas there is no limit to the degree of skill that can be brought to how we conduct ourselves in the world; we cannot reach the point of being a perfect, flawless saint, no more than we can reach infinity.

Daniel points out that what is 'negative' and 'positive' is often a question of perspective. This causes some people to fall into moral relavisism and assure morality is totally subjective and hence futile to bother with. However Daniel believes it is better to do our best and fail rather than not try at all. 

Training in morality is important as Buddha taught that what we think, say, and do has consequences for our subsequent moment-to-moment experience. Hence training oin morality proceeds from the premise that if we can improve what we think, say, and do, we will improve our situation and that of others. We assume we have the capacity for positive change and to positively change our world. We take responsibility for our actions and their consequences. 

Training in Morality is aided by [[Training in Concentration]]: by paying attention to what we think/say/do we can make them more wholesome and let them be more influenced by improved morality. 
The converse happens too; morality aids concentration because wholesome and solid mental and physical habits will aid our ability to sit down and tran.

Daniel writes in MCTB that the training at its best is grounded in a theoretical or direct appreciation of the vital recognition of [[Interdependence]]: an appreciation of the fact that we are all in this together and that we all share the wish to be happy and avoid misery. He advises building the habit of considering the welfare, feelings, and perspectives of those around us.
Ruairi: This recognition likely contributes to [[The Miracle of Compassionate Awareness]]

*
The word 'ponder' here is important; we must contemplate these things and not simply write lists. As [[Adyashanti]] says of [[Contemplation]] in [[10 Literature Notes/Books/The Way of Liberation]], our ability to sit with something and contemplate it, to hold it in our mind and thoroughly examined it, has been weakened by the internet, instant gratification, and the ability to get any knowledge in moments; we confuse ease of access to information, and retention, with contemplation and the gaining of wisdom.
