# WL Practice Absolute Sincerity
The fourth of [[The Five Foundations of Liberation]] from the book [[The Way of Liberation]].

This encompasses honesty, integrity, and genuineness.
It does not mean to be perfect; indeed the attempt to be perfect or to see oneself as perfect is not sincere.
Cultivate the honesty and courage to see yourself as you truly are, with your flaws and weaknesses as clear as your strengths and abilities.

Let go of being judgemental of yourself and others.

ðŸ’¬ '*The capacity and willingness to be honest with yourself is your greatest guard against self-deception and deceit. There is no greater challenge for a human being than to be completely honest with oneself as well as with others, and yet such honesty is absolutely necessary if we are ever to awaken from our dream of separation and live a truly genuine and undivided life.*'
