The cockroach example is a simple example of how our brains do not generate a perfect model of reality in our minds - some parts are distorted or untrue because this helped us to survive in the past.

Most of these delusions are to do with how and what thoughts arise in our mind.

## The example
It's 2019 and I'm loving my new life in [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]].
I'm living and working from a one-room condo. 
One day I saw a cockroach scuttle around the floor and under my bed.

My immediate reaction was
'Ugh! Filthy creature. I heard if you kill them, smaller bugs that live on their underside will fall off and spread around your room. Now when I go to sleep tonight I'll be wondering where the bastard is hiding.'

But my meditation practice had just begun to bear some noticeable fruit, and I followed this up by thinking
'Actually, I'm distorting this situation. The cockroach is neither good nor bad. These are just labels my mind is assigning to them. In reality it's just a living creature like me, that seeks out good experiences, turns away from bad ones, and flees in fear when threatened with death. My initial reaction was negative and produced a small amount of stress and suffering in my mind, but really it did that itself by reacting this way in the first place.'

This is a skill that gets stronger and stronger the more you use it and the more you meditate.

It is mostly our thoughts that get passed through this lens. Back in our [[Hunter-Gatherer]] days, it was beneficial to have the initial reaction of disgust, as we would then keep hungry critters away from our precious food. There are numerous examples of distortions like this happening in all of our minds, every moment of every day. By slowing down, building our concentration with [[Training in Concentration]], and examining all thoughts that arise via [[Training in Wisdom]], we can begin to live less and less in this illusory world of thoughts.
