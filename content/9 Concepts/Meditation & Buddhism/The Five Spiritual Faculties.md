**From MCTB:**
*"The five spiritual faculties are said to be like a cart with four wheels and a driver. If any of the four wheels is too small, wobbly, or not in balance with the others, then the going on the spiritual road will be rough. The four wheels symbolize faith, wisdom, energy, and concentration. If the driver is not paying attention there will also be problems. The driver symbolizes mindfulness.

This is a really useful teaching and quite a fine list. The trick is that faith and wisdom must both be strengthened and kept in balance, as must energy and concentration. Mindfulness may always be increased, so for this one the sky is the limit, but no need to obsess about it."*

Daniel recommends checking in with these five faculties if something in our practice seems off, as it will inevitably be sometimes, and to ask 'Could I perhaps work on strengthening these or brining them into balance?'


## Faith
Paraphrasing Daniel:
Too little faith can lead to giving up, half-hearted effort, and bitterness. 
Too much faith can lead to blind adherence (Ruairi: See [[Never Abdicate Your Authority]]), dogma, and being disappointed when your teachers don't meet your expectations.
