Impermanence is one of the [[The Three Characteristics]] making up reality that the [[Buddha]] taught.

It says that all phenomena we experience are impermanent, and hence everything constructed from them (i.e. everything our reality is made up of) are impermanent too.
A good way of putting it is that, out there in 'the world' and in here in our own 'personal reality', there are no constants, only a constantly changing process.

> ðŸ’¡There are no constants - only process.

It says that names and categories are just terms invented by us clever little humans to help understand the world, but that this is a fundamental illusion/delusion built into our reality by natural selection, as to see reality in this way is a  evolutionary advantage, e.g. the ability to see a stick, vine, and sharp rock, assembled in a certain way, as one thing, an axe.

But the axe is never still, it is always changing. When the handle is picked up, it changes - small bits fall off due to the friction of your hand, molecules change position and level of energy, etc. Nothing stays the same, though it would appear to, at least temporarily, at the specific level of reality we humans are conscious at.

Consider a pen, made up of 
1. Cap
2. Ink cartridge
3. Metal nib
4. Main body

What happens when you take away one part? Two? Three? At what point is it not a pen? Pen is just a term we've given to a certain group of ever changing atoms.

Nothing stays still, not even for a second - neither at the deepest level of reality where atoms are constantly moving, changing, and exchanging energy, nor in our inner experience, where thoughts constantly arise and pass away, and close inspection reveals a lack of a separate, permanent 'I' or 'me'.
