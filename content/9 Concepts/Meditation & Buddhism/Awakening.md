# Awakening 

Also known as Enlightenment, Liberation, and Self-Realisation. It is reached by having a deep and consistent [[Meditation]] practice. 

## Qualities
Awakening according to the book [[The Mind Illuminated]]:

- Complete and lasting freedom from suffering 
- True happiness
- Realisation of and awakening to ultimate truth.

It is a cognitive event that dispels ignorance through direct experience of how the world really is, and not the fictional, fantasy world that we construct in our minds by filtering the outer world through our ego and self of sense.

A mind with this kind of insight experiences life, and death, as a great adventure, with the clear purpose of mainfesting love and compassion toward all beings. 


## Why is this an option in the first place?
Awakening is a possibility because we all experience a distorted version of reality that is filtered through a lens built by evolution and natural selection.
