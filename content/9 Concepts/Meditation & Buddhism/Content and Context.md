[[Content and Context]] is an idea or viewpoint in meditation that says everything in our conscious experience can be broken down into

**Context:** The aware space in which all experiences arise and pass away.

**Content:** Everything that is not the aware space - thoughts, feelings, emotions, sounds, sights, etc. All experiences.

[[Adyashanti]] recommends contemplating and investigating this during ones meditation practice, saying it is useful because it means we are not looking for any particular spiritual experience, the 'right' experience, as experiences are content in the context, and it is the context we are investigating. 
He further recommends 'feeling' your way around context, not thinking too deeply on it. That we are 'shifting' our way of being to a different part of our brain. 
*What if I relax the attempt to grab hold, just relax into what it **feels** like to be aware.* Relax the gripping he says. Release your tension in order to **feel** the context. 
When doing this he advises we do not quickly jump back to thinking 'Is this it?' when something unusual begins to happen, because we are switching back to trying to **know** as opposed to just being **aware.** The knowing and attempt to grasp knowledge will often come as tension according to Adya, hence relaxing is a big help.
