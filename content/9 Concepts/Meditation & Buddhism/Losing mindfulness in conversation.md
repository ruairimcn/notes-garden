On my [[May 2021 Pa Pae Meditation Retreat|10 day meditation retreat]], I noticed that my mindfulness decreased when I was in conversation with other people; there were also signs up saying as much and encouraging less talking.

This note will explore this concept further.

'It's difficult to stay in stillness and awareness while speaking, while engaged in conversation with another. Doing so *is a skill you can build.* It requires vigilance to not be dragged along with a mind-stream as soon as you open your mouth.' - [[Eckhart Tolle]]'.
