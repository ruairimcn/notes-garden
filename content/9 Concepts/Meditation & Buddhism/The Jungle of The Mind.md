[[Krishnamurti]] describes one's journey from illusion to [[Truth]] as being in a jungle.

'If once you realized that you are responsible entirely for yourself, that you are in a jungle, literally a jungle, where you have to make your own way out. There is nobody to lead you.'

'You need vitality and strength to get through. But the moment you depend on leaders, you become weak.'
