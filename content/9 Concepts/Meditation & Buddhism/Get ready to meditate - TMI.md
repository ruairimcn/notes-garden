- Balance attention with peripheral awareness.
- Follow the breath. Look at it in detail. Compare how it changes and how it's linked to your state of mind.
- Relax. Look for joy. Observe. Let it come, let it be, let it go.
- Use labeling and checking in.
- Avoid moving, move mindfully.
- Apply antidotes to subtle dullness.
- If awareness is high, try to stop subtle distractions from becoming gross distractions.
- Once you are settled, try feeling the breath in the body.
- Scan for and dissolve tension.
