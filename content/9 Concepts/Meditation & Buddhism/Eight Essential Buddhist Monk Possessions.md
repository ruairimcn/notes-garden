According to the [[Pali Canon]] of the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]], the 8 essential items that a [[9 Concepts/Meditation & Buddhism/Buddhist Monks|monk]] is allowed to own are
1. Inner robe
2. Outer robe
3. Additional robe for protection from the elements
4. Alms bowl
5. Water-strainer (water filter? #Unsure)
6. Razor for shaving 
7. Needle and thread
8. Any necessary approved medicine 


This is the 'essential' list, depending on the temple or [[Sangha]] the level of adherence to this may vary, e.g. some may be strict and only allow items on this list, whereas some may allow other items such as books, phones, wristwatches, etc.
