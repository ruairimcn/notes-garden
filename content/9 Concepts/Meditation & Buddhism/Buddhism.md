Buddhism, once seen as a religion, has now become (in my humble opinion) a religion, a philosophy, way of living, and one of the most in-depth guide or manual to the human mind that exists.
Or at the least, what was once mainly a religion for over 2,500 years can now also be interpreted as one or more of
- a philosophy,
- a way of living,
- amental practice or training,
-  and more, depending on which parts you focus on.

The parts of Buddhism that most interest me are those relating to [[Meditation]] and [[The Dharma]], which includes three primary trainings :
[[Training in Morality]]
[[Training in Concentration]]
[[Training in Wisdom]] 

I tend not to distinguish between schools of Buddhism while taking notes (maybe this is unwise and I should reconsider? #Unsure) but generally it's related to [[Theravada]] Buddhism, as I live in [[Thailand]] and this is the school I have had the most exposure to.


# The Buddha
Born Siddhhartha Gautama, [[Buddha]] is the founder of Buddhism, credited with its teachings. 


# Teachings of Buddhism
There are a few broad but deep concepts taught by Buddha in Buddhism, which fall under the umbrella of [[The Dharma]]:
[[The Three Trainings]]
[[The Four Noble Truths]] - often regarded as the Buddha's main teachings as they are thought to be the first thing he taught.
[[The Dharma]]
[[The Eightfold Path]]
[[The Three Characteristics]]
[[Buddhism Precepts]]



# Ways to Practice Buddhism
- Join a [[Sangha]], one of the [[Threefold Refuge]].
- Practice [[Meditation]] daily
- See [[Practical Buddmism]]

# History of Buddhism
[I've leave this one to Wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism)

I've read some of the history of Buddhism and while it interest me I am more interested in the theory and practices of meditation. (See [[How I Choose What Notes to Write]])
