The Five Hindrances are formally listed as 
- Sensory desire
- Ill will or malice
- Sloth/torpor
- Restlessness/worry
- Doubt


From MCTB:
*"Each of these states of mind will inhibit meditative progress if we are not aware of them as senate objects for investigation as they arise. [They] are anything of which we were not mindful and of which we did not investigate the truth. If we did not understand at least one of the three characteristics of each of the sensations that make up a phenomenon, no matter what it is, it is a hindrance."*

Use any and all hindrances as Insight fuel. Shift your perspective from being annoyed when they arise to being excited at having Insight fuel!

*The speed, precision, and playful attitude required for video games is exactly like the feel of well-done insight practice.*
