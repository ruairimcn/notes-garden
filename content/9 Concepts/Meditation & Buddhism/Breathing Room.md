A Breathing Room is a concept I first heard about from the Vietnamese [[9 Concepts/Meditation & Buddhism/Buddhist Monks]] [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]

You can read it in his own words here:
https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/thich-nhat-hanh-breathing-room/

It is 
- A room in your home of any size$^1$
- For breathing and peace of mind
- Lightly decorated
- Respected as an area where no one is allowed to shout
- A calm place for when you feel sad, angry, or uneasy.


No matter who falls out or how $^2$ in the home (or office, [[Sangha]], many places really), either party can go here to cool down without being shouted at.

Thich Nhat hanh suggests we consider adding an altar to the Breathing Room. He says it doesn't mean we're worshipping them (though one can), rather:

> ☸️ For example, placing a statue of the [[Buddha]] on the alter is a reminder of our own capacity to me mindful, awake, loving, and accepting. Creating and maintaining a home alter is a way to pay respect to the world around us, our ancestors, and the natural world, and to remind us that whatever we love and respect is also within us.


$^1$ (or a space or corner in a small home)
$^2$ Except for breaking the law perhaps.


# My Breathing Room
I'm fortunate enough to have a home with a small spare room that is now my meditation and breathing room.
