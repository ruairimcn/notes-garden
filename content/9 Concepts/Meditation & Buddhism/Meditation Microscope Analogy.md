This is an analogy about studying the mind that compares developing a meditation practice to building one's own microscope.

## The Outer World of Science
If you study biology in school, you wil learn that all living things are made up of a vast number of cells, such as blood cells and bone marrow cells in humans, amongst many others.
But being told these facts is not the same as experiencing reality as being this way. How do you know this to be true for certain? Photos and videos can be doctored in this day and age.
Well, in the modern world we live in, microscopes can be bought online. You slice the skin off an onion, put some iodine on it to mark the cell walls, pop this onto a slide and under a microscope. Now you can see for yourself that the entire onion is indeed made up of individual cells. 


## Meditation - The Inner World of the Mind
The study and training of one's mind in meditation is different - **we have to build the microscope ourselves.**

In [[Samatha Vipassana Meditation]], we first build our concentration (Samatha) and then use this concentration to examine all of the sensory input that makes up our reality (Vipassana) - do this long enough and well enough and you can experience [[Awakening]].

In essence, what you are doing in this practice is building a microscope with which to examine your reality, and to try to see how the [[The Three Characteristics]] exist in all sensations. 

Spiritual guides and meditation teachers can tell you how to build your concentration, and how to examine relaity in order to see it more clearly. **But they cannot provide you with the tools that are needed to do so.** Instead, you have to follow their instructions on how to build this mental microscope, and how to use it effectively.

It is not enough to be told, and understand intellectually, that
- Sensations are impermanent ([[Impermanence]])
- Sensations don't bring lasting satisfaction ([[Dissatisfactoriness]])
- Sensations cannot be said to be a fixed self, nor can anything else in our experience ([[Insight into No-Self]])

I understand these things because I've read and studied them. But I haven't taught my unconscious mind to understand and recognize them, and this is required in order to experience [[Awakening]]. I am still building my microscope up piece by piece.
