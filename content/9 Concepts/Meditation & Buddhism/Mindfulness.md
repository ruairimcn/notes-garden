# According to Sam Harris
According to [[Sam Harris]]:
' You are always meditating on something: your attention is always bound up in something. We largely become what we pay attention to. We are building our minds in each moment - building up habits, desires, worries, expectations, prejudices, insights. *Mindfulness is just the ability to notice this process with clarity, and then priorities what you pay attention to.*'
