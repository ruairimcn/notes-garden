#Podcast between [[Sam Harris]] and [[Adyashanti]] on the [[Waking Up App]].



## Podcast Notes
- [[Adyashanti]] (Adya) describes how initially in his early 20's his practice was very intense, focused, and driven. But this eventually led to him questioning if it was causing him to break psychologically. When he reached 25 (an age he says he intuitively felt he would die at when he was younger, but was not fearful of), he sat down to practice and thought 'I can't do this anymore.' This was followed by an awakening experience. **He now teaches that one should practice with effort as it is a key ingredient, but with the least amount of effort possible.**


### Adya's Brief Practice Instructions
1. Spend a few minutes focusing gently on one's breath to calm the mind and central nervous system.
2. Look for any sort of self, fixed person, little man in your head that is 'you'. Is there one. 
3. Try to see that the send of self is inserted into consciousness by thought and isn't there, that what's left is awareness, or an aware 'space.'
4. Do the above more so as a 'feeling' or 'intuiting' action as opposed to trying to logically think it through and work it out. 


He recommends distilling everything into [[Content and Context]].

He points out that different pointers (to turning awareness on itself) work for different people. [[Pointers to Awareness]]


### Quotes

*'The "me", or the imagined me, is kind of a shapeshifter. You get on to it in one form and it knows you better than you know yourself, it just kind of takes a  different form, it's like the content masquerading as the content. *


*'It does not depend on going to a deep state'* (It is immediate and instant as Sam Harri says)

*It is as present now whether we recognise  it or not as it will ever be in any experience we have.*


*We have deceived ourselves more than anyone else has deceived us.*

*You're allowed to question but only everything.*

*You are not going to hear me tell you at any point during this retreat the absolute truth.*

*What these teachings are pointing towards is something that is beyond the teaching.*
