[[Loch Kelly]] offers several ways of glimpsing awareness (Specifically [[Non-Dual Awareness]]), or rigpa; that which knows, is aware, and is prior to our identity, profession, gender, all of it.
It is a form of [[Meditation]] 


# Questions to ask 
- This space in which thoughts and sensations arise: are you aware *of* the space? Or *from* the space?
- Are you aware of stillness? Are you aware of energy, thoughts? Are they made of awareness?
- Can you look without a looker?
- Where are you aware of your knee from?
- Where are you aware of the space in the room from?
- How does it feel to know, to be alert, *without orienting to thought?* 
- There is a *knowing* you can let go into; you only need hold the intention to let your local awareness rest as this spacious, embodied awareness. 
- Trust that there is an interconnected no-self, luminous self, that you can feel without orienting to thinking, without creating a thinker, without the need for a second opinion.
