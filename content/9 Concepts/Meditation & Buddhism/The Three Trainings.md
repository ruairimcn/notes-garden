The Three Trainings are three areas of training in [[Buddhism]] as taught by the [[Buddha]].

They are practical trainings that go a lot deeper than one might initially expect.

# The Trainings

[[Training in Morality]]. Working on being a better person (knowing that the definition of what this is differs from person to person). The base from which to practice the other two meditation trainings (it's harder to still you're mind if you've done things you consider 'bad')

[[Training in Concentration]].  Improving your ability to focus/concentrate on a chosen meditation object. Leads to extraordinary meditative states such as [[Samatha]] and [[Jhanas]].

An excellent base for the next training.

[[Training in Wisdom]]. Also known as Vipassana or Insight Meditation. Involves examining all sensations that arise in our consciousness in order to see reality as it truly is.

# Sources
My current and favored source for a general overview on The Three Trainings, and an in-depth look at [[Training in Wisdom]] is [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]].

For [[Training in Concentration]] my go-to book is [[The Mind Illuminated]]

I have yet to choose a good candidate for [[Training in Morality]] but from my first scan of the book, [[A Path With Heart]] is looking good.
