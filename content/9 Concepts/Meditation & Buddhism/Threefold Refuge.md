**Also known as:** Three Jewels, Triple Gem, Three Refuges

The Three Jewels are three ideas/concepts that Buddhists 'take refuge in.' From a secular point of view, they are three things that can help each of us to have a smoother journey in our [[Meditation]] progress, and our progress along [[The Spiritual Path]].


The Three Jewels are
1. The [[Buddha]], the man who worked out said spiritual path and whose teachings can bring us to [[Awakening]].
2. [[The Dharma]], the teachings of the Buddha.
3. The [[Sangha]], a monastic order of Buddhism that practices [[The Dharma]]. In a secular light, or 'lay light' (a lay person is someone who is not a monastic, i.e. not a [[9 Concepts/Meditation & Buddhism/Buddhist Monks]]), a Sangha is any community or group where members help one another to understand and practice [[The Dharma]]. An example is my [[TMI Study Group]].


## Faith in the Threefold Refuge
Even if you look at Buddhism in a completely secular light (which I mostly do - see [[Secular Buddhism]]), there is still faith involved (see [[The Five Spiritual Faculties]]), because while meditation is a science, it is an internal science of the mind, and we hence rely on other people's words and descriptions of experience to understand it and see the value in it.

For the psychonauts reading this, it's like trying to describe a psychedelic trip to someone who has never experienced it before. If they don't believe you, or have faith in you, they will dismiss it.

As someone who grew up in a secular family, I steered clear of meditation and Buddhism for years, as I was somewhere between Atheism and Agnosticism as a teenager. But reading more and more on these two topics slowly made me see that there is in fact a whole new world behind these two things that one can explore when their mind. However, the cost of entry is quite high in that it takes a daily commitment of time to start and build a meditation practice. **So I needed a certain amount of faith to get started.**

You can develop faith in the [[Buddha]], recognizing him as a mortal man who discovered some amazing and profound facts about how our minds really work and how reality really is, who put together a set of teachings that can build our mindfulness, reduce our suffering, and give us a clearer picture of reality.

You can develop faith in [[The Dharma]], by reading books, watching YouTube videos, and talking & listening to people who say they have seen the benefits of [[The Dharma]] for themselves.

And you can develop faith in a [[Sangha]] by finding one that has like-minded, trustworthy individuals who you can journey along this path with.

Ultimately, less faith will be needed as you begin to experience the results of meditation for yourself.
