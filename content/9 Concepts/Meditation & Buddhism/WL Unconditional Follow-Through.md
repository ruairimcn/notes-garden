# WL Unconditional Follow-Through
The second of [[The Five Foundations of Liberation]] from the book [[The Way of Liberation]].

Once you have done the first step of [[WL Clarify Your Aspiration|Clarifying your aspirations]], you need to follow through on it.
This requires both deciding on 
- what you are **willing to do/.**
- what you are **willing to let go of doing.**

This is about following through **now,**, in the present, with sincerity, as opposed to working towards an abstract, future goal. 
Focus only and always on the [[Eternal present]].

This is moreso done in the heart than in the mind, and is reflected in your actions, not your thoughts, feelings, or words. 


> ðŸ’¬**When aspiration lines up with unconditional follow-through and love, it becomes a very strong force in the universe. Only then are we unified and one-pointed enough for our aspiration to survive the winds of folly, fate, and circumstance. **
