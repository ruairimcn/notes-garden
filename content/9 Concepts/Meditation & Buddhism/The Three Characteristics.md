The Three Characteristics are a core part of the teachings of [[Buddhism]]. 

They are:
- [[Impermanence]]
- [[Dissatisfactoriness]] 
- [[Insight into No-Self]]


These are three delusions or illusions present in the minds of all beings, except those who have achieved [[Awakening]].


## Basis and Cause
As with many things in meditation, there is a strong basis for all three of these in [[Evolutionary Psychology]] (also see [[The Lens of Natural Selection]] and [[The Evolutionary Argument Against Reality]]). 
The basic premise is that it was more beneficial throughout evolution for living things to see/interpret reality in a way that benefits their survival. Due to this, we all see life through [[The Lens of Natural Selection]]



## Overcoming Them
[[Vipassana]] meditation involves examining all the sensations and feelings that make up your personal reality, in order to try and perceive the three characteristics directly and consistently. If one can do this well enough and long enough, [[Awakening]] will follow. 
It is not enough to understand them on an intellectual level (though I think this helps) - one must examine them in such detail that our unconscious minds (which is what builds our reality, not our conscious mind) realise they have been seeing reality all along, and hence the lens through which we see reality shifts to one with a much clearer and accurate view.



## Further Reading
The best material I have read on the Three Characteristics can be found in the book [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]]
