Samatha Vipassana Meditation is a combination of both [[Samatha]] and [[Vipassana]] methods of training the mind.

**Samatha:** Related to [[Training in Concentration]] as taught by Buddha and well described in [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]]. 

Involves improving one's mindfulness (by improving attention ([[Meditation - Attention]]) and peripheral awareness( [[Meditation - Peripheral Awareness]] )) in order to access unique concentration states, eventually being able to abide in Samatha (a state of joy, tranquility, and equanimity amongst other things.)

**Vipassana:** Related to [[Training in Wisdom]] as taught by Buddha and well described in [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]].

Involves examining and learning from all of the sensations that make up our personal reality, in order to see and understand that the [[The Three Characteristics]] are present in all of them - if our unconscious mind realizes this, it can cause a full or partial [[Awakening]].



## Getting Started
My understanding is that it is best to begin with [[Training in Concentration]] first, as you need to have a certain level of attention and awareness to to do Vipassana, or [[Training in Wisdom]]. If you can't focus on your breath consistently, it's going to be difficult to focus on all the sensations making up your reality consistently.

This is the path taken by the particular meditation book I practice from - [[The Mind Illuminated]]
