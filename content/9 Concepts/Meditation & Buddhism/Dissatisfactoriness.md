Dissatisfactoriness is one of the [[The Three Characteristics]] making up reality that the [[Buddha]] taught about.

It links directly with the first of  [[The Four Noble Truths]]: 
[[There is suffering or dissatisfactoriness]]

Also called Misery or Suffering, the [[Pali]] word for it is *dukkah.*

> ðŸ’¡There is no thought, mind state, or thing that provides lasting satisfaction.

## Summary
Dissatisfactoriness, at its core, says that the way in which we humans perceive reality means we can never find lasting satisfaction in the outer, material world. The main reason ties in with the other Characteristic of [[Impermanence]] - everything is momentary. Your 5 star meal will be gone soon. The 10/10 movie you're watching must end - even TV shows with 12+ seasons must come to a standstill eventually. 

But the other crucial ingredient in our suffering here is that **we cling on to things as if they were permanent.** Because we want and expect things to last, we inevitably end up disappointed when they do not. It takes the phrase 'Change is inevitable' to its ultimate psychological conclusion. 

Another factor at play here, from psychology, is [[The Hedonic Treadmill]], which is how once our happiness goes up, it must always come back down, keeping us stuck on a never-ending treadmill of seeking more and more happiness. Just think back to the last cool, expensive, shiney gadget you bought, or anything you bought that made you really happy. How long did this happiness last? How long until you wanted another new shiny thing? A few days?

Alas, the great promise made by the Buddha is that **it doesn't have to be this way.** By doing Insight ([[Vipassana]]) meditation, we can come to see through the illusion created by the [[The Three Characteristics]].


## Further Reading
The book [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]] contains direct practice instructions on how to see through Dissatisfactoriness.

Here are some good parts from the chapter on it: 


We suffer because
*we take the senate data coming in and misinterpret those sensations in a way that causes us to habitually create the illusion of a permanent, separate, independently functioning (acasual), localized self. This mode of perceiving reality is more painful than the other way that senate reality can be perceived, in which sensate data imply the exact reverse: that there is naturally occurring, casual, self-perceiving, immediate transience. Insight practices can show us this other, less painful way of perceiving reality, and eventually hardwire it into our systems so that we don't ho back to the more painful way which involves the dukkha created by this misconception.*

*Dukkha sounds grim or pessimistic, and perhaps deservedly so in a sense, but it is also a powerful statement that our moment-to-moment separate self experience cannot, does not, and will never provide lasting satisfaction.  Why? One reason is that everything is momentary. Nothing last, meaning that you can experience everything that you normally think of as a solid world arising and passing by instant by instant. So what could last for even the blink of an eye to satisfy? Nothing!*

*The point is not to be a gloomy, pessimistic, or nihilistic cynic. This sort of attitude will not help on the insight front. **What does help is an understanding of something in our relationship to all things. There is no thought, mind state, or thing that provides lasting satisfaction.***
