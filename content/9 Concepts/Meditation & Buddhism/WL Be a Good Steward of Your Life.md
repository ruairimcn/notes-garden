# WL Be a good steward of your own life	
The fifth of [[The Five Foundations of Liberation]] from the book [[The Way of Liberation]].

This means taking full responsibility for your life, being [[Proactive instead of reactive]].
It also means not using spirituality to avoid any part of your life. This is a process of revealing, not covering.

Your entire life is itself your path to awakening - all must be revealed and embraced.
