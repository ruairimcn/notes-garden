# Vipassana

Vipassana refers to Insight into the true nature of reality that radically transforms our understandinf of ourselves and our relationship to the world. Meditation produces other mundane insights - understanding of our own personality, flashes of creative brilliance, etc - but these useful lowercase i insights are not vipassana as they neither transform us personally, nor our understanding of reality, in any profound way.

The vipassana Insights are not intellectual - they are experiantially based, deeply intuitive realisations that transcend, and ultimately shatter, our commonly held beliefs and understadings.

The five most important of these insights are
- [[Impermanence]]
- [[Emptiness]]
- [[The Nature of Sufferring]]
- [[The Casual Interdependence of all Phenomena]]
- [[The Illusion of Self]], No-Self


The first four Insights can be experienced by using [[Samadhi]] and [[Sati]] to investigate phenomena with persistence and energy. The fifth insight of No-Self is the culminating insight that produces Awakening, as only by overcoming our false, self-centered worldview can we realise our true nature. As well as the first four Insights, it requires the mind to be in a state of [[Samatha]].
