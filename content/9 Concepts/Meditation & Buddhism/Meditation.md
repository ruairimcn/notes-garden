Work in progress.

**Links:**
[[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]] (MCTB) - excellent book, much of my notes relating to meditation are from this book.
[[The Mind Illuminated]], same as MCTB, many of my meditation notes come from this book. It explains the mind and consciousness very well, along with a 10 Step meditation path to explore.
