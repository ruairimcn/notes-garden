The Lens of Natural Selection is the way in which all animals experience reality through a mental lens that has been developed by natural selection.

According to this theory, it is more beneficial for animals to see a distorted version of reality, if this version improves their odds of survival. It can be hard to understand how and why this happens, so here is an example.

## The Cockroach Example
This is an example I like to give people:

When I moved to [[Thailand]] for 7 months in 2019, I discovered the book [[The Mind Illuminated]] and I begun a meditation practice.

A few months into my practice, I was working out of my condo and spotted a rather large cockroach darting around the room, eventually hiding under my bed.

My immediate reaction was
'Ugh! Filthy creature. I heard if you kill them, smaller bugs that live on their underside will fall off and spread around your room. Now when I go to sleep tonight I'll be wondering where the bastard is hiding.'

But my meditation practice had just begun to bear some noticeable fruit, and I followed this up by thinking
'Actually, I'm distorting this situation. The cockroach is neither good nor bad. These are just labels my mind is assigning to them. In reality it's just a living creature like me, that seeks out good experiences, turns away from bad ones, and flees in fear when threatened with death.''

It is mostly our thoughts that get passed through this lens. Back in our [[Hunter-Gatherer]] days, it was beneficial to have the initial reaction of disgust, as we would then keep hungry critters away from our precious food. There are numerous examples of distortions like this happening in all of our minds, every moment of every day.


## 7 Billion Realities
Another way of looking at this is that every one of us humans on the planet has his or her own reality going on inside their head. You've seen this numerous times; two people reacting very differently to the same situation. People saying someone said something, and someone else saying they said another. 
Our brains take the input from our senses and construct a sort of illusion in our minds that matches up pretty damn well to what's happening in the 'outside world' of reality. Not convinced it's an illusion? Go and Google some good optical illusions. Or do the blind spot experiment.

The reality constructed by our senses is pretty similar across our species - similar but not exact. Consider color blindness.
However it's not usually our senses that our lives evolve around, it is our thoughts. And our thoughts are shaped by the billions of years of evolution and natural selection that have gone by. We are [[Self-replicating Machines]], constructed from DNA, and DNA's mission is to improve and spread itself. If our bodies are built for this purpose, it stands to reason that our minds our too. And if you build a good meditation practice, you can examine this for yourself.
