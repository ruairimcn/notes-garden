Born Siddhhartha Gautama, [[Buddha]] is the founder of Buddhism, credited with its teachings. By all accounts he appears to have been a real person ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha)) and the only founder of a major religion who did not claim to either be God or directly inspired by God ([Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/introduction-cultures-religions-apah/buddhism-apah/a/the-historical-buddha)).
