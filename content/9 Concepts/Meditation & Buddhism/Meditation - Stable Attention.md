# Stable Attention

**Stable attention** is the ability to intentionally **direct** and **sustain** the **focus of attention**, as well as to control the **scope of attention**.

Intentionally directing and sustaining attention means we learn to choose which object we're going to attend to, and to keep our attention continuously fixed on it.

Controlling the scope of our attention means training the mind to adjust how wide or narrow our focus us, and being more selective and intnetional about what is included and excluded. 

Stable attention is the most valuable tool we have for investigating our minds and coming to understand ourselves. 


## Spontaneous Movements of Attention
To develop intentionally directed, stable attention, we must have a clear understanding of its opposite, spontaneous movements of attention. 
Attention moves in three different ways:
- **Scanning:** This is where our focus moves from object to object, searching the outer world or the contents of our mind for something of interest.
- **Getting captured** happens when an object - thought, bodily sensation, external stimulus - suddenly captures our attention. 
- **Alternating** is a subtler kind of scattered attention only apparent to experienced meditators. Our attention always alternates, but the non-meditator doesn't notice this: instead they think they are focusing on two or more things simultaniously, when in fact their attention is just rapidly alternating between one or more things.** Anything that stands out from the background of peripheral awareness does so because it is intermittently becoming an object of attention.** The continuity of attention is an illusion.
