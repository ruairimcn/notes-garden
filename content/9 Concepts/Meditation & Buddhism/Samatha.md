# Samatha
Samatha is a mental state one can reach by [[Training in Concentration]], i.e. by focusing on a meditation object to improve one's [[Mindfulness]]


It has five characteristics:
- Efforlessly stable attention ([[Samadhi]])
- Powerful mindfulness ([[Sati]])
- Joy
- Tranquility
- Equanimity

It results from working with samadhi and sati until joy emerges. Joy gradually matures into Samadhi, and equanimity arises out of that tranquility. A mind in samatha is the ideal instrument for achieving Insight. 

Samatha is one of the four factors/ingredients of awakening. It is a state of tranquility or calm abiding.
