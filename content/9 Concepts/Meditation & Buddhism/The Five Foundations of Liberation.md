# The Five Foundations of Liberation
The Five Foundations are the bedrock of the teachings from [[The Way of Liberation]].

They are essential to the process, both *before and after awakening.*

They are a way of living and manifesting Reality in daily life - to not do this is to live a split life.

They provide the context for the unfolding of the teachings. To remove the context is to put yourself at risk of an egocentric interpretation of the teachings. 

# The Five Foundations are
1. [[WL Clarify Your Aspiration]]
2. [[WL Unconditional Follow-Through]]
3. [[WL Never Abdicate Your Authority]]
4. [[WL Practice Absolute Sincerity]]
5. [[WL Be a Good Steward of Your Life]]
