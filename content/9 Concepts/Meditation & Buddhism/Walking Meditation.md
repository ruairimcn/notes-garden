Walking meditation is a method of practicing [[Meditation]].
There is great information on pracitcing it available in the book [[The Mind Illuminated]], as an Appendix in the back.

## Summary
Instead of your typical meditation object, e.g. the breath for me, you take the feet (and sometimes legs) as your meditiation object.

My practice as per The Mind Illuminated is
1. Only move one foot at a time and focus on that foot.
2. Notice as many sensations as possible, and label them at the outset. 3 is good to start with:
	1. Foot lifting off the ground
	2. Leg and foot moving forward
	3. Foot making contact with ground
Your mental labeling might go like:
'Lifting, moving, placing. Lifting, moving placing. Lifting...'

With practice you can up this to 9, e.g. mine is
1. Heel lifting off ground
2. Sole lifting off ground
3. Toes moving off ground
4. Leg going up
5. Leg going forward
6. Leg going down
7. Heel touching ground
8. Sole touching ground
9. Toes touching ground

My mental labeling goes like:
'Heel, sole, toes, up, over, down, heel, sole, toes.'


## Benefits

I have found that waking meditation is an excellent partner to sitting meditation, particularly the combo of 30 minutes walking followed by 30 minutes sitting.
It can be easier to sustain focus on the sensations in one's feet, compared to the breath, as they feel stronger, more viceral, easier to notice.
It is also an excellent antidote for [[Strong Dullness]] which is a challenge in [[TMI Stage 4 - Continuous Attention and Overcoming Gross Distraction and Strong Dullness]]. As a result I often change from sitting to walking meditation in order to combat dullness.

I discovered its value while on meditation retreat - [[May 2021 Pa Pae Meditation Retreat]]. A great Australian monk, Lumpi Carl, taught it to us and we sometimes did it for 30 mins followed by a 30 min sit.
