**Links:** [[The Four Noble Truths]] [[Buddhism]]

Buddhism says that 'Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional.'
As mortal human beings, pain is indeed inevitable - sickness, ageing, and death await us all. But **the amount of suffering that this pain causes us can be lowered.**

## Notes from book: MCTB
[[Daniel Ingram]] in [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]] (MCTB) writes:
*To understand this first truth is to understand the whole of [[The Spiritual Path]],so take the time to investigate it.*

*The basic gist of this truth from a relative point of view is that we want things to be other than they are, and this causes pain. We want things that are nice to last forever. We want to get what we want and avoid what we don't. We wih bad things would disappear faster than they do. **These are all contrary to reality.** We all age, get sick, die, have conflicts, constantly scramble to try to get something (greed), get away from something (hatred), or tune out from reality altogether (ignorance). We are rarely if ever pefrectly content with things just as they are.*

*These are the traditional, relative ways in which suffering is explained. They are very important aspects of life to tune in to, and are considered essnetial points to reflect on to inspure us on the path and encourage some healthy measure of holding this transient world a bit more lightly...*
