# Daniel Ingram MCTB Advice
In his [[Meditation]] and [[The Dharma]] book [[Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha]] (MCTB), [[Daniel Ingram]] gives advice about [[Meditation Retreats]].

Daniel says that to make quick progress on [[The Meditative Path]], it is advantageous to
1. Do lots of practice in daily life
2. Go on more and longer retreats
3. Be able to consistently concentrate and investigate quickly and precisely
4. Pay attention more often during daily activities
5. Have your morality trip more together


Retreats are settings designed to let you practice all day in a way that facilitates precise inquiry and depth of meditation - they are conductive to quicker and deeper development.

Give them all your wholehearted effort. 

You build momentum slowly on retreat and lose it quickly so keep your foot on the gas. Try to be mindful every second from rise until sleep. 

Apply this advice while keeping [[The Seven Factors of Meditation]] in mind and balance them skillfully.



## On Retreat

The first days are often spent adjusting to the schedule, routine,etc, and the last few thinking about what you'lol do when you leave - hence Daniel recommends retreats of at least 6 days as the middle days are often the best.



### Shadow Side
Every retreat center and tradition has its shadowy aspects and downsides - as do all of we. The perfect meditation retreat doesn't exist, keep this in mind and keep cool. 

Keep proper hygiene and etiquette with bathrooms, common spaces, and shared resources - small slights can be magnified by ones high concentration into big issues, so be respectful and thread lightly. 

When you have humans together, you will always have corruption, miscommunication, crushes, scandals, politics, etc. 

Solo retreats can make you think you have fewer issues than you do as there is nothing like intereracting with others to show us blind spots in relation to our issues. 


**The key point is that great practice can occur in conditions far from perfect - realize all sensations that make up these inputs and our reactions to them are al worthy if investigation and thus are a source of ultimate and relative wisdom, as well as any other sensations. **



# Key Reminders

1. Don't indulge in your crap
2. When in doubt or struggling, note these sensations and everything else.
3. If you have a question, the answer is in the three characteristics.
4. Analysis is not the same as practice.
5. Practice at all times when awake; be mindful during transitions between sessions.
6. When nobody is around, practice just as hard.
7. Remember how precious these moments are and how rare the opportunity to go on retreat is.
