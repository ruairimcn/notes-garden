No-self is one of the [[The Three Characteristics]] making up reality that the [[Buddha]] taught.

At its core, No-Self means that all of us humans imagine that we have a fixed, permanent 'self' inside our heads, making rational decisions in the world. The idea of a 'soul' fits the description here for some people, but it also means the secular view of there being a 'me.'

## Examining the idea
Not convinced? I don't blame you. So let's look at some ways of dispelling the notion of a self.

1: **You are not the thinker or maker of your thoughts.**
What is your favourite movie? ...Have you thought of one? 
How did you pick it? Did you think about every single movie you have ever watched, or did one just 'appear' in the forefront of your mind? 

Now choose a second contender for your favourite movie. Watch how this process unfolds in your mind. Is the answer simply arising out of your unconscious mind? Or are you doing the choosing here?

Now 'pick' a third movie. Some will argue that, now having three options, 'they' get to 'pick' a favourite movie from amongst them. But *even choose one from among the three isn't something that you really get to control.* Your answer is utterly conditioned by your past, your experiences that have been recorded in your brain since you were born. Since your thoughts come from here, and since 'you' didn't get to choose much of your past (where you were born, your parents, the era in which you were born), can there really be a 'you' inside your head?

Alas, as with everything in the [[The Spiritual Path]], the invitation here is no to take my word for it, or any authors, or spiritual teacher including [[Buddha]], rather it is for you to investigate these ideas for yourself. Don't take mine or anyone else's word for it - instead build your own mental microscope with which to examine your mind and see if there are any sneaky illusions hiding in there (spoiler, there are quite a few...). For further reading on building this mental microscope see [[Meditation Microscope Analogy]].



## Evolutionary Cause
Much of meditation has its roots in [[Evolutionary Psychology]].

It was not beneficial for humans, as we developed language and society, to understand no-self. 
Take this imaginary conversation:

*Ooka builds a primitive stone axe*
**Urk:** What an amazing tool Ooka! With it we can chop down trees. How did you come up with this idea?
**Ooka:** Well, I didn't really come up with it, the idea just popped into my head to be honest, all by itself. In fact I don't seem to have any control over my thoughts whatsoever  :) 


What really happened:

*Ooka builds a primitive stone axe*
**Urk:** What an amazing tool Ooka! With it we can chop down trees. How did you come up with this idea?
**Ooka:** I'm a smart guy Urk! I'm a self-made man with a fabulous intellect. Because I can build these great tools, I am worthy of more respect for the tribe and should be elected as our Fearless Leader.

Much better for our survival odds if we see ourselves as being the masters of our own minds. Indeed this is a key part of how our society is built, that we see each of us as being a separate, autonomous self.
