CRAP Design is a simple framework of design principles.

It stands for **Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.**


# Contrast
Good design makes use of contrast between different elements. 
As an example, the different groups of content should contrast against each other.
E.g. the title and subtitle on a poster should look distinct to the date and time, using contrast.

It is important that contrasting elements are different enough to stand apart, they shouldn't be 'slightly' different or 'a little different', be bold!


# Repetition 
Repeat design elements to keep parts of the design coherent. Different designs, motifs, background images, and icons can be repeated to pull the design together. 


# Alignment 
Different elements should be aligned to prevent designs from looking scattered and disorganized. 
E.g. in web design it is common to have an invisible margin on the left and right that no content goes past, to keep everything in line.



# Proximity
Related content/objects should be grouped together, e.g. the title with the subtitle, the date, time, and location together, etc.
