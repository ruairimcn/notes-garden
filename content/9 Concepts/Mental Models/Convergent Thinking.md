Convergent thinking is thinking that focuses on finding what is usually the main or single well-established answer to a problem. It generally does not require a lot of creativity, and is usually used to answer things like multiple choice tests where logic can be used to deduce a clear answer. 

It is the opposite of [[Divergent thinking]].
