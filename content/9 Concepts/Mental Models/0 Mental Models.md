Mental models are ways of simplifying complexity in order to better understand the world. They shape the opportunities and we see and the connections we make in our minds. They are representations of how something work and are important because, as we cannot keep all of the details about the world in our minds, we need to simplify.

The below list is compiled from [[Farnam Street]], an excellent website all about making better decisions and [[Separating Signal from Noise]].

I will be listing them here first in order to use them as connections to other notes, and over time I will add more content and examples to each one.

**Goal:**
My goal is to learn about and internalise all of these mental models over time, in order to improve my decision making and hence my quality of life and that of others who are affected by my decisions.


## Mental Models

### General Thinking Concepts
[[The Map is Not The Territory]] - Maps of reality are not reality, they are not exact, as they are reductions of what they represent. 

[[Circle of Competence]] - Know what you understand and don't understand. 'I know I know nothing' as [[Socrates]] said.

[[First Principles Thinking]] - Breaking something down into its elements and building up from here to make better deductions. 

[[Thought Experiments]] - Devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things.

[[Second-Order Thinking]] - Looking beyond the immediate results of one's actions. Thinking further ahead and holistically.

[[Probabilistic Thinking]] - Using math and logic to estimate the likelihood of a specific outcome.


[[Inversion]] - Invert it, flip it, turn it upside down. Start from the end, think backwards.

[[Occam's Razor]] - A principle of logic and problem solving that states 'Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones.'

[[Hanlon's Razor]] - States that we should not attribute to malice what is more easily explained by stupidity. 


### Physics and Chemistry
[[Relativity]] - Used in several contexts in physics, the one we are interested in is 'the idea that an observer cannot truly understand a system of which he himself is a part.'


[[Reciprocity]] - If I push on a wall, it pushes back with equivalent force. 


[[Thermodynamics]] - Laws regarding energy in a closed system, they underlie the physical world and have far-reaching effects even in the social world. 


[[Interia]] -  An object in motion with a certain vector (speed as well as direction) will continue moving in that direction unless acted upon.


### Biology
[[Tendency to Minimize Energy Output]]
### Systems


### Numeracy


### Microeconomics


### Military and War


### Human Nature and Judgement
