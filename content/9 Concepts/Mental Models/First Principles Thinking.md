Also called 'reasoning from first principles', the idea is to 
'break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.'

'It allows [us] to cut through the fog of shoddy reasoning and inadequate analogies to see opportunities that others miss. '


# The Basics
'A first principle is a foundational proposition or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption.'

'Reasoning by first principles removes the impurity of assumptions and conventions. What remains is the essentials.'


Reasoning by analogy is the opposite of first principles reasoning. Most of us use a blend of the two.

# The Cook VS Chef Analogy
A chef reasons by first principles. He can cook without a recipe as he understands cooking, food, flavor profiles and combinations on a fundamental level. He has real knowledge.

A cook can only use recipes. Maybe he can do slight variations on dishes but without a recipe, when stuck with what is only in the pantry, his lack of fundamental principles and knowledge will cause him to fail, or at least not succeed on the level that a chef can.
