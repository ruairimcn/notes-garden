# Run a server in your bedroom
To show how important servers are for hosting websites, lets look at how you could host a website from your bedroom

Let's say you have built a [[WordPress]] directly on your computer using [[Local by Flywheel]].
You are ready to show this website to the world. 
You set up one of many types of hosting software on your computer, maybe you choose XAMPP. This has all the tools needed to 'host' a website.

**Problems:**
**1: Security.**You have to do some configuration on your home wifi router in order to allow people from the outside internet/world to connect through to your computer via your router. If done incorrectly this can be a security vulnerability - first problem.

**2: Speed.** Your internet is fast but not super-fast; at this moment everyone in your family is streaming their own Netflix movie or YouTube video; now your website is slow.

**3: Hard to keep online 24/7.** You will eventually need to bring your laptop somewhere, or turn it off, or repair it. When you do your website goes down and *in this day and age people expect websites to always be accessible, 24/7 365.* 


Servers from reputable hosting companies have high security, high speeds, and most aren't on 100% of the time but will guarantee something close like 99.9% uptime each year. 

Hosting a website on your own computer is a great way to learn and practice, but shouldn't be used for live websites that the public will be accessing.
