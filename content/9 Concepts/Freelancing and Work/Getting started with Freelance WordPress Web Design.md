**Links:** [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]] [[Service VS Product Business]]

**Note:** This note and notes it links to are an evolving work-in-progress. It will take some time to fully flesh it out to encompass the advice I have from 5 years working as a freelance WordPress web designer. 

# Intro
For the last five years or so, I have worked part-time (about a year) and then full-time (about four years) as a freelance WordPress web designer.

This has been an immensely valuable and rewarding career for me. It is also one of the topics that I know the most on and have the most experience on.

So, I will be putting together an **overview guide** here on how to become a Freelance WordPress Designer. By '**overview**' I mean that for many areas of this career I will be pointing you to other resources, e.g. for HTML, CSS, and JS I will be directing you to [[freeCodeCamp]] as it is an outstanding resource and one I will never be able to offer as much value as.

But as I go further into my own specific processes and workflows, the information will be more niche and coming directly from me. Learn the basics of this industry, and then see if you like my particular methods and workflows.


## Is Freelance Web Design for Me?
Unless your fairly certain on what skill you want to freelance with, or what skill in general you want to make money from, take a read through [[Finding a skill you love doing]].

## What is the work like? What does it entail?
Here is my particular flavour of freelance WordPress web design that I have been doing for 5 years, and that this series of notes will show you how to do:
- I use [[WordPress]] and [[Elementor]] page builder to build websites, sometimes starting from pre-made templates, sometimes starting designs completely from scratch. **A lot of my time on a typical project goes into creating and improving the website design.**
- I do very little coding, though I know and often use [[CSS]] to help tweak designs. Sometimes I write [[HTML]], occassionally I write [[Javascript]], and I understand a little PHP, enough to read and make use of debug and error logs.
- Since I don't code much, I use [[WordPress Plugins]] and various [Software as a Service](SaaS) to add functionality to websites. E.g. [[WooCommerce]] plugin for doing [[eCommerce]]
- I mostly work for SMEs - Small-to-Medium Enterprises. Examples are hair salons, bars and restaurants, financial advisors, gyms and clubs, charities, eCommerce for retailers, and more.
- I do almost all of this work myself, from sales and invoicing, to project management and post-sales support, to the nuts and bolts of designing and building websites.
- I work for myself, choosing what work to do and what direction to move the business in.
- I am selling my time for money. This kind of business is more of a job role/position you make for yourself, as opposed to a business that can make money while you sleep, e.g. selling an information product or physical product.


## How much can I earn from it?
The sky is the limit, if you keep upskilling and improving your portfolio, you can be charging €100 - €500 an hour if you get good enough.

It's hard to give advice what hourly rate to charge or what fee to charge per project since everyone starts charging at a different level of skill and experience. It varies by country too and even where you live in a country. But for beginners I think €20 to €30 an hour is a good starting rate. 

Personally, I earned around €41,000 before tax in 2020 from doing freelance web design. That's after about 3 years part time and 2 years full time (full time meaning my main focus but hours varied from week to week, could be 20 one week and 40 the next). 


# The Curriculum
## Initial Principles
#WorkInProgress 
For basic and initial principles, things like
- [[Digital Security]]
- [[Principles of honesty and integrity]]
- [[Basic file organisation]]
- [[Business etiquette]] 

## Web Design and WordPress
1. Go through [[freeCodeCamp]], cover
	1. [[HTML]]
	2. [[CSS]]
	3. [[Visual design]]
	4. Basic [[Javascript]]
2. Learn about [[WordPress]]. Play around with it, start some websites, install some plugins. [[Local by Flywheel]] is a great tool for locally hosting and managing websites (keep them on your computer instead of paying for web hosting - see [[Online VS Local Hosting]]).
	1. Learn and experiment with the excellent visual page builder for WordPress - [[Elementor]]
3. Learn about visual design - how to make websites look good and easy to navigate. [[Recommended reading for visual web design]]
4. Learn about relevant internet technologies
	1. [[Domains and DNS]]
	2. [[Web hosting]]
	3. [[Email hosting]]
5. Learn about relevant resources and libraries - [[WordPress Resources]]




If you get a handle on the above and work on tieing it all into a web design 'process' that you go through for each website, you will have a great grasp on the basics of WordPress web design (at my way of doing it at the least!).

Next up we will look at the project management, and sales side of things. But if you want to get started right away without having to do sales, invoicing, etc, you can
- Make a website for free or for some cash for friends or family
- Make up a 'mock' or 'dummy' or 'fake' business or organisation, and make a [[Dummy Website]] for them
- Make a personal website about you, or a website for a particular interest

Either of these will start getting you experience and will become better and better items for your portfolio with practice.


## Business Name and Branding
Let's start off with your bread and butter - the name and branding that you freelance under.

**Note that I have a good understanding of logos and branding but I'm not an expert in them so I advise doing your own research here too.**



### Name
What's in a name, eh?
For freelancers there are two main options here:
1: Use your own name
2: Create a business name

#### Option 1: Use your own name

**Pro: Consistent name**
The big benefit I see to using your own name is that business names can change, especially  early on in your career. I've operated under many names (partially because I started young, 15 or so, and had a lot of learning and exploring to do), such as
- Red Star Designs
- Elemental Design
- Emerald Design
- RM Creative
- [[Propeller Digital]]

Some of these were with a team, some were solo. Had I kept mainly working under my own name, I might have had a wider-reaching reputation. But I'm not sure if that would be the case as I think with freelancing people tend to get to know you by your name, especially if you are the only one working with them. I.E. even when working under a business name I think clients mostly recommend me to other people by my name.

**Pro: Quick and easy**
You don't have to brainstorm and comb through a list of possible names to find a good one.
And in many countries there is some sort of registration or paperwork to work under a business name. For fellow Irish freelancers see [[Registering with the CRO in Ireland]]. Using your name saves you this time and money.


**Con: Not good for expansion or working with a team**
If you decide to work with a team in the future, either ith employees, business partners, or as a [[Freelance Collective]], it might not make sense to use your own name. 
That being said, unless you are planning to set this up in the future, it's probably fine, in my humble opinion, to work under your name for the first few years, and if you decide to grow it beyond youself, consider changing to a business name.


#### Option 2: Create a business name
The Pros and Cons here are the opposites of the ones listed above.
Aside from that I can't honestly come up with any other pros and I reckon it comes down to personal preference. 

If you happen to have (what most people would consider) a difficult-to-pronounce, odd, or unusual name, a business name might be better. Your name might be 'normal' in your country but might not be in other countries you sell in or plan to, so consider this. 
 


### Branding
Branding consists of all the ways your business is presented visually, primarily
- Name
- Logo
- Colours
- Fonts

#### Logo
Your big decision here is whether or not you set this all up yourself, or pay someone else to do it for you.

**Doing it yourself:**
You will need to learn the basics of branding and logo design, then learn to use some design tools to put your logo together.
This will cost you time, and possibly money if you buy a tool like [[Affinity Designer]], though free tools are available like [[Inkscape]].

**The time  investment is worth it in my opinion,** whether you are new to design or not. If you're new to design this is a great way to get started with it, land some experience, and get familiar with design tools like [[Affinity Software Suite]] or [[Adobe Creative Cloud]].


**Paying someone to do it:**
This will cost a lot less time bu cost more money.
You can find someone local in your country, or you can go online to service marketplaces like [[Fiverr]] and [[Upwork]].


**Logo tips:**
Your logo should
- Be verstile. Work well on a small business card or large bill board, smal social media profile photo, or large website banner. 
- Be simple. Modern and minimal designs are popular at the moment, are easier to create than complex designs, and look elegant.
- Be memorable. Your logo doesn't need to instantly explain everything you do, and no logo can do this. What it can be is a unique identifier for your particular business, so that people will remember your business and all its positive qualities when they see your logo again.


I may add more info on this in the future, for now as it's not my main area of expertise (it's outside of my [[Circle of Competence]]) I will leave you to do further research yourself :)




#### Colour
Look into colour psychology and use a tool like [[Adobe Color]] to chose complementary/matching colour.
A good rule of thumb is to have three colors:
1. **Primary** colour that is used for 80% or so of a given design
2. **Secondary colour** used 15%.
3. **Accent** colour used 5%.



#### Typography
A good setup is to have one font for headings, and one font for the body text.

Some basic advice:
- Pick a font that is legible/easy to read.
- Look into serif and sans serif fonts and pick one style to use.
- Some fonts are web friendly meaning most browsers have them, these are a good choice. 
- Beware of the license, some fonts are free for personal but not commercial use. 

##  Legal: Type of Business, Banking, Contract
### Type of Business
This is dependent on your country, if it's not too complex you can navigate this area yourself.

**In Ireland** you are likely looking at setting up either a Limited Business, or working as a Sole Traders.

Sole Traders just have to register for income tax and pay what they owe. Either look into this yourself or get an accountant, **do not** neglect this and end up owing a large tax bill. If you want to work under a name other than your real name, you will have to register this business name with the Companies Registration Office.

Limited Companies are more complex and cost more to set up. Look into this yourself if it's of interest.

> 💡 For most freelancers, it is best to start off as a Sole Trader.


### Bank
You can use your own personal bank account, or you can set up a business bank account.
I use Revolut for Business and find it to be great so I recommend it.
I recommend keeping your personal and business income and expenditure separate for easier accounting.

### Accounting
In most countries (check yours) you are legally required to keep accurate records.
Make a folder on your computer, or use Excel, or an online accounting tool, and collect and file all invoices that you pay, that you send to clients for payment, and all receipts. 

You need these in the event that you are ever audited, and you need them to either submit your own tax return, or for an accountant to do it for you. 

For most people this is not fun or sexy work, but it is needed in order to stay on the right side of the law, and to know what the financial situation is at all times. 


### Project Contract
I advise getting all clients to sign a simple project contract if the project is big, e.g. for a new website. I don't get clients to sign a contract for a few hour's editing a website, I do get clients to sign a contract if they are paying me 4 figures for a new website.

I'm not a lawyer or an expert on contracts but in my opinion you don't need a perfectly written legal contract, just something simple that you and clients can understand.

**A good contract covers:**
1. **The scope of the project.** It's important to [[Defining project scope|define the project scope]] so that your client knows exactly what they are getting and you know what to produce. If a client asks foe something outside of this scope, you can now say 'Since that's not in the project scope it will cost X and take Y to do.
2. **The length of time the project will take.** This can be as simple as a start and end date, or can be broken down into further milestones, such as deadlines for content submission and payment 
3. **The fees involved.** How much will this cost the client? What fees are paid to you and what is paid to 3rd party providers? What are the ongoing fees, if any?
3.  **What is required from the client.** What do they need to do? What kind of content do they have to send you?




## Defining a Website Project
All of the topics covered here are important for freelance web designers.
But this one, defining the project, is possibly the most important, as it will have a disproportional impact on the rest of the project; a small mistake here can snowball into a time and money sink later on.

This step will affect Sales as you need to know the full scope of the project to quote correctly (scope is everything that needs to be done to complete the project. [[Scope creep]] is where this grows beyond what it was originally and is a major threat to your time and money).

Defining the scope of the website project means **setting out exactly what you are going to do and what the client is going to get, within a budget of X and by deadline Y.**

This can be more difficult to do with other types of digital freelance work, as websites can be so flexible and multi-purpose that they can quickly get out of hand and grow into much larger projects. Clients also don't always fully understand how time-consuming certain parts of the web design process can be, so this needs to be made clear upfront. 

### What you need to define
1. The content. What content is go on the website? Who is responsible for creating and gathering this content? How many pages will the website have?
2. The functionality. What **EXACTLY** does the website need to do? Clients often won't have an appreciation of the importance of get the the functionality completely written down at the start so make sure you convey the importance. Otherwise you will end up having to spend time and money on plugins for unplanned functionality that costs you time and money.
3. The design. What style of design is being aimed for? What are similar websites that the client likes? How many design revisions can they have? 
4. The cost. How much does the client pay you, and when? Roughly how much should they expect to pay for 3rd party services like hosting and domain names? What happens if they decide they want extra functionality and/or content during the project?
5. The deadlines. When does the client need to get their content to you? When can they expect a V1 website? When will it be launched? When do they pay you? 


Essentially you need to come up with as many questions and unknowns about the project as possible and have your client answer them. 


Take time and care with this process. Your client has a picture of their desired end product in their mind. You have two important things to do:

**1: Help the client to clarify and solidify the picture they have of the desired end-goal.** If the client does not have a clear picture of what they want, help them to make it clear.
**2: Get their picture into your head.** You need to see what the client is imagining. This is a skill and getting better at it will make your work value and your job satisfaction significantly higher by reducing stress and fiction. 

*It is your job to do this, NOT your clients. You need to ask as many questions as needed from as many angles as needed until you have a clear idea of what your client wants. *


## Sales
Sales is one of the most important parts of freelancing - you have bills to pay and financial obligations that need to be met in order to keep a roof over your head and food on your plate.

Sales has consistently been the most challenging part of my whole career. A lot hinges on it - my ability to buy food, pay my rent, party on the weekends, buy new books to read - and it has you competing against many many other freelance web designers, as the market is somewhat saturated given the low barries to entry (in my humble opinion).


### The Key to Sales
> 💡I believe **Persistence** and **[[Thinking outside the box]]** are the two most important skills for sales done by freelancers.

With these two skills you can keep trying many different sales methods and approaches. It's a numbers game, and you need to experiment with methods to find the best one.

With **Persistence** you can make up with any skills that need improving that are tied to success - speaking clearly and articulately in sales emails or on sales calls, being confident yet relaxed, learning to price properly and negotiate, etc.

The main thing is to keep trying, trying, trying. Try cold outreach. Try websites that sell leads such as [[Bark.com]] and [[Upwork]]. Try posting on LinkedIn. Try a blog and email newsletter. Work out how much you need to live and aim a little higher than that.
No one can do this work for you and everything else hinges on this one part, so be prepared to get to know the world of sales intimately.

**Recommended reading: **[[SPIN Selling]]


### How to do sales
Sales is about having enough work coming in to keep you afloat.
To do this, you need to:
1. **Get your business out there.** Let people know you exist. Post online, go to loca/online events in your industry to network with others. 
2. **Set out your offerings.** What do you do? What services you provide? Be able to concisely explain what it is you do and how you can add value to other businesses. Know your plans and. pricing. 



### 


### The Sales Pipeline
Various businesses and individuals will enter your sales pipeline as leads, and some of them will make it through to the end and become clients; the flow is like a funnel with many at the start and few at the end, hence the name.


####  Leads
Businesses, organsiations, and individuals out there, scattered across planet Earth, will at some stage run into you and your business. They will touch one of a few **touchpoints** with you - maybe they see your LinkedIn profile, or you get talking at a conference, or you're on the same Zoom business meetup and they hear you are a web designer.

These interested parties are **Leads.**
Sometimes they will stumble across you through other people - a [[Referral from your network]].
Sometimes it's [[Inbound Marketing]] , where you create interesting content for business owners, and they come across on social media, your blog, email newsletter, etc. You reel them in with useful content that is relevant to them and also shows you know what you're talking about.
Sometime's it's [[Outbound Marketing,]] where you blast out your message on radio, online ads, etc. More expensive and less useful to small freelancers.

Whatever it is you focus on, **the more Touchpoints you can create for your business the better.**

#### Prospects
Prospects have had a positive interaction with your business and are contemplating purchasing a service from you.

Possible next steps include
- A free 30 minute online consultation to work out their requirements, then provide a quote and a proposal.
- If they have an existing website see [[Critiquing website as a sales tool]]


Your goal is to get them to agree and then close the sale:
- bill them (I bill 50% at the start and 50% at the end)
- Have a [[Website project contract]] signed


#### Customer
Your Prospect becomes a Customer once they have paid you in part or full for a service. Treat them well - you're going to need a lot of happy clients to make this work! 


### Using a Customer Relationship Management system
A [[Customer Relationship Management System]] (CRM) is a piece of software specifically for managing leads and nuturing/turning them into customers.

My advice to beginners is **do as much as possible with simple, free tools first.** E.g. use [[Google Sheets]] to manage your leads.
Benefits:
- Tools like CRMs typically cost a monthly fee. Use Spreadsheets to reduce monthly bills and expenses.
- A knowledge of Excel/Google Sheets and spreadsheet formulae will benefit you throughout your career, making your own CRM is a great way to learn this.

There are lots to choose from, my favourite is [[OnePage CRM]].




### Invoicing
You closed a deal? Congratulations! Now for the next challenge - getting paid into your bank account.

In the Western web design industry, it's common to bill 50% at the start of the project (ideally before work begins) and 50% at the end (ideally before you launch the website).
Some do 33/33/33, or 25/25/25/25 at different agreed project milestones. 

I do 50/50 and this has worked fine for me.


#### Invoicing Software
As with CRMs there is a wealth of software to choose from.
Many good invoicing tools have a very generous free plan.
Many will also let you send invoices that clients can by via debit/credit card through card processors like [[Stripe]].

Unlike CRMs though, this is an area I recommend you use a dedicated tool for due to [[The importance of proper accounting]]. You are legally obliged, in most countries, to keep proper records of all financial transactions. I am not a lawyer or accountant so seek advice from one if you are unsure as to the laws in your country. In most countries [[Ignorance of the law is not an excuse to break it]] and if you neglect your accounting and tax responsibilities you can end up in trouble down the line.

**Tools include:**
[Zoho Invoice](https://www.zoho.com/uk/invoice/create-send-invoices/)
[Wave Apps](https://www.waveapps.com/) - I used to use this but they started focusing on N.American businesses only so I switched to Zoho Invoice



## Project Management
So you've turned a lead into a customer. Your 50% deposit payment has landed in your bank account, a contract has been signed - now it's time for you to start delivering!

For me, project management is about completeing your projects in a calm, professional, organised way that minimises headaches for you and your client. Smooth project management means you don't get overloaded with work, clients aren't complaining about deadlines being missed, and in general your life will be nice and relaxed. So it's important to get right!

### Project Management is software-agnostic
Before I dive into telling you about the specific tool I use, [[Basecamp]], it's important to know that, like every process outlined here, **project management is software-agnostic: what matters is the outcomes you get from the processes you follow, not the software.**

There are so many tools out there for project management that it can cause [[Decision fatigue]] due to the number of options. But at the end of the day it's how you implement it and the processes that you follow that make the big difference.
That being said,** the software you use is a very important decision a**s it will have a strong effect on how your project management goes - see principle [[Your tools shape your thinking]].

So I advise you start off simple and use a mix of [[Google Docs]] to get this done initially and ot get a feel for your new business; once you have a better idea of your own project management needs, you can do a better job of choosing the right tool.

Or start off with a simple tool that has a generous free plan:
[Asana](https://asana.com/)
[Trello](https://trello.com/)

## WordPress Workflow
You've closed the deal, received the 50% deposit, and had a kickoff call with your client to gather their requirements - now the design and development begins!

We will cover the whole WordPress process, from initial setup through to launching the live website.

In this workflow, by **Development** I mean the work we do getting a website created and launched, not specifically coding. A **development website** (or dev website) is a website we are working on. It is a **live website** once we launch it to the public for our client. 

### Review the Project Brief
Start by reviewing the [[Project Brief]] so that you can make informed decisions for this specific project.


### Local Or Online Hosting
Your first decision will be whether you develop the new website offline/locally or online/remotely. I usually do online but do what's best for you. Here are some comparisons to help you decide:

- Online is better for sharing the website with the client, and is needed if you are working on it with other people who need to be able to access it. Some local platforms do have a feature for sharing the website with clients.
- Offline is quicker as there is no internet lag since you're working locally, and since your whole computer is running the website, instead of it being on a shared hosting account, this can make it run a little quicker. 


#### Web Development on Online Hosting
For online hosting, I recommend the following:
1. Take out a hosting account that can handle multiple websites
2. Take out a domain for development websites online (not a required step but I like having a separate domain for working on all new websites)
3. Set up a new WordPress installation and a new subdomain for each new website. Share the URL with the client as needed.

It can be good to use a time-saving tool like Softaculus, a web app manager, installer, cloning, and backup tool that makes it easier to manage WordPress websites.

#### Local Hosting with [[Local by Flywheel]]
There are various tools available for working with websites offline, my preference is for 
[[Local by Flywheel]]




### Base WordPress Template
Once you have chosen to host locally or online, you can set up your WordPress development website.
Instead of creating each new website entirely from scratch, I recommend having a template website that you use to start each new project.
This template should grow overtime and improve as your own web design process and skills improve. 

At the outset, you won't have your own template, so start from scratch and make a template as you go, or use someone else's template to get you started :)
The template we use at [[Propeller Digital]] is constantly changing, and plugins and themes always need updating 

#### Plugins
#### Theme
#### Elementor
#### Softaculus Clone

### ManageWP
[[ManageWP]] is a tool for managing multiple WordPress websites.
It is a great tool with multiple useful features that we use from the start of the development process through to post-launch maintenance. Click the note link to read more about it. 

I connect development websites to ManageWP once I initially set them up. I turn on premium daily backups as you can easily recover the website from any major issues.
