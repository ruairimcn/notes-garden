# Dummy Website
A dummy website is a website that you build for a fake/made-up purpose, e.g. for a fictitious businesss.

They are an excellent source of experience for those learning web design, and for learning the overall career of  [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]].

If you're struggling to find something to make up for this, think outside the box. There are plenty of imaginary examples you could do.

Alternatively, you could offer to do a website free of charge, say for a local community group. But beware of taking on a job you can't handle, as even though it's free they may invest time in it and you don't want to leave them with a piece of shit website :)
