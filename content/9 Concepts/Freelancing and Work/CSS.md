# CSS
CSS is...
Best learned about on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA)

I'll only be lightly covering it here as there are many great resources for learning CSS online.

# Summary
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It turns barren HTML documents into beautiful websites (if used well!).

It separates the content from its presentation, and while it can be inside .html files, it can also reside in its own .css file type.



With HTML you can tell a web browser what each part of the page is:
- What is a heading: H1, H2, H3 etc
- What text is bold or in italics
- What is media, e.g. photos, videos

Here is a screenshot of Facebook with only HTML, i.e. no [[CSS]] to make it look pretty:

## LEGO Analogy
I like using LEGO as an analogy for coding and web design.

[[HTML]] is like basic LEGO building blocks. But they are bland and colourless. 
You can build a house with HTML and it will have identifiable rooms (bedrooms, office, kitchen, etc), but they won't look great - it's not the kind of house you would want to live in.

[[CSS]]  adds colour and style to your LEGO house. 
It lets you change the size of bricks, their colour, their edges, curves, and more. 
With CSS you can create a LEGO house that you would actually want to live in! 


# Cool Stuff
[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a great website to take a look at, it is the same HTML page displayed very differently using only CSS.
