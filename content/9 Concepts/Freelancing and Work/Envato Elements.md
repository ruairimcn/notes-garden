# Envato Elements
Envato Elements is a monthly subscription service by Envato that gives access to a huge library of digital resources for around â‚¬30 a month, including
- Stock photos and videos
- Graphic templates for brochures, business cards, posters, etc
- Stock music
- [[WordPress]] plugins and themes
- and more


It's well worth checking out and I think it's worth it for the [[WordPress]] resources alone.

They have a WordPress plugin that gives easy access to stock photos and templates for Elementor, as well as WordPress themes.
