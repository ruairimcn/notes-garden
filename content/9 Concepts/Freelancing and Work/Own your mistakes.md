# Own your mistakes
To own your mistakes is to put your hand up and say 'That was my fault.'
To do so elegantly, in a way that preserves or improves relationships, might look like:

'This was my fault. This is why it happened. This is what I will do to ensure it doesn't happen again. My apologies.'

I have written emails like this where the offended party was very impressed by my honesty and I turned a burning bridge into a valuable ally - you just need to push down on your [[ego]] a little as it hates owning up to mistakes!

It's very tempting to not do this, especially if you have a potential scapegoat. 
**Don't do it.** Practice the [[Principles of honesty and integrity]].
