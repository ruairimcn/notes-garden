# Summary
WordPress is a [[Content Management System]] used for building websites such as
- Blogs
- Brochure websites
- Sales websites
- eCommerce stores

## Advantages
- It's free!
- It's [[Open source]]. Updated and maintained by a large community of coders.
- There are many many marketplaces online for free and paid WordPress plugins and themes, these allow you to add powerful functionality to WordPress websites. 
- It is relatively easy to use, both for you and for your clients.
- It has excellent 3rd party page builders available such as [[Elementor]]


## Disadvantes
**Note:** As my colleague Oliver pointed out, the below are disadvantages of WordPress *when used with plugins and page builders*. WordPress itself doesn't have these issues but the kind of web design I'm teaching here requires plugins and page builders.
> üí¨ I think the main disadvantage of WordPress really is it gives you the freedom to do things badly.  - Oliver

- You need to be careful about security; WordPress plugins can have temporary security vulnerabilities, more often than you would likely expect or like.
- The speed of a finished website likely won't be **super** fast because a WordPress business site will have many plugins on it, and because page builders often add a lot of 'junk' HTML. This can be mitigated if you upskill in web development.
- WordPress core software, plugins, and themes will need regular updates to keep the website running fast and secure from hackers.

# Personal experience
WordPress has been the backbone of my web design career for over 5 years now. 
Most of the income and experience I've gained in the field of web design was directly with WordPress. 

WordPress took me from surviving to thriving abroad in [[Thailand]]. 
I've helped businesses to sell online and charities to raise funds with it. 
I've build forms for shoulder and knee surgeons, helped startups to get off the ground, all with WordPress.

For these reasons it will always hold a special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è

# WordPress.org VS WordPress.com
There are two 'types/flavours' of WordPress available:
**WordPress.org** is the free, open-source version of WordPress, a ZIP file you can deploy to any server to use WordPress. Whenever I talk about WordPress, I mean this one.

**WordPress.com** Is a *managed*  WordPress website where you can't access the code; it's all looked after for you. Similar to the likes of [[Shopify]]. There is a free version available.
