# JupiterX theme
JupiterX is an excellent theme for WordPress.
It uses Elementor and comes with, at the time of writing May 2021, 300+ templates that use Elementor.

It has been a very valuable resource to me during my [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]] career due to the large number of templates that cover many business industries, and it also has a very good control panel, and is bundled with other plugins.

I generally use either this theme, or the [[Hello Elementor]] theme on all of my new websites.
