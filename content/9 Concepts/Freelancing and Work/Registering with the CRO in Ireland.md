I'm not a lawyer or business expert so best to do your own research but if you want to work as a [[Sole trader in Ireland]] then you have two options as to your business name:

# 1: Work under your own name
If your name is John Doe, you operate under your name. It has to be exactly your own name, e.g. it can't be Doe Builders.


# 2: Register a business name
If you want to trade under a name that isn't your real name, you have to register the name, once, with the [Companies Registration Office](https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Business-Name). This cost around â‚¬25 when I did it and was a simple process.
