# Business etiquette
This is my own take on business etiquette for freelancers.

## 1. Be polite
- If you wouldn't say it to your mother, don't say it to a client!
- Sometimes in business, things get heated. But never be the one to crack as you are the one getting paid. Keep calm, composed, and cool-headed even if tensions are rising. If an email chain is getting heated, take a break before replying.

## 2. Be transparent and open
- Let clients know what to expect from you; how often do you check emails? How quickly do you respond to problems? What are your working hours? **Avoid surprises.**
- If something isn't reasonable or possible, like a deadline, don't nod your head and smile - be up front and say what needs to be said. 
- Be open about how you work and what clients can expect from you.
- Be clear and direct about fees, pricing, 3rd party expenses, etc. Surprises are bad, financial surprises are worse.
- Don't be a Yes Man. If you're not sure, say so. 
- See [[Principles of honesty and integrity]]

## 3. Be reliable
- Deliver work on time and on budget. And deliver a good end result.
- Get it done. Fix it. Find a work around. **Try to always come back to clients with solutions instead of problems.**


## 4. Be a human, not a robot.
- **Be yourself.** One of the benefits of working for yourself is that you can decide, in some areas, how to present yourself. I've found it beneficial and even enjoyable to be myself around clients, as opposed to being rigid, too business-like, cold and mechanical, etc. Don't be afraid to tell a joke, ask a non-business question, etc, though do judge this based on what you know about your client.
- This is especially important in sales I think, as it adds a human element to sales work that can sometimes be cold and transactional
- **Be helpful.** If you have small opportunities to help, do so. It's important to charge for your work but also important to build relationships. If you're being paid a few grand to build a website, 20 minutes unbilled work setting up your clients email signature can go a long way. 


## 5. Be concise.
- Respect people's time. Keep emails and calls as short as possible.
- Don't waffle, use filler words/fluff, don't try to pad out proposals, etc. Business people tend to have good bullshit detectors!
