# Elementor
Elementor is a responsive visual page builder for [[WordPress]].
Out of the box, WordPress has a basic WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor that has your typical Microsoft-office-like tools: Lists, bolding, italics, paragraph or headers 1 through 6, etc.

To go beyond free and basic WordPress themes, a page builder is necessary to create websites that look great (unless you go custom coding your own themes, which I don't).

Some other page builders include WordPress's own Gutenberg Editor, Oxygen page builder, and Divi. My preference is for Elementor but this is not to say which is the best.

# Learn to use Elementor
There are plenty of great resources out there on how to use Elementor so I'll only be giving a few tips here.

**Tips:**
1. **Practice, practice, practice.** Watching YouTube tutorials and reading the Elementor Docs won't get you the hands-on experience that you need in order to master this tool. Theory is great but get stuck into using it, either for [[Dummy Website|Dummy Websites]], or free/cheap websites for friends/family, or jump into the deep end with a paying client if you're feeling ready!
2. **Utilise theme libraries.** There are hundreds of Elementor themes out there that you can use to great effect, provided you change them up enough with the client's branding to make it be a unique website. Good places to go are [[Envato Elements]] and [[JupiterX theme]].
