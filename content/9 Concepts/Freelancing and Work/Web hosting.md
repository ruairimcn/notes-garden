# Web hosting
Web hosting is a service that lets you 'rent' space on a server, where you can store a website or web app in order to have it be accessible 24/7


# Introduction to the Internet
First read [[Introduction to the Internet]].

Having read that, and done some reading of your own if needed, you should now have a basic understanding of
- Domain names
- DNS records
- Nameservers


# What is a server?
A server is a special type of computer, a computer being any type of device that can do computation, from small embedded computers in cars, to smartphones and laptops.

A server is set up specifically to host online content:
- Apple's online store is on a server somewhere
- All of Netflix's and Spotify's content are on servers somewhere
- You are reading this website of mine via [[Obsidian Publish]] which is hosted on a server somewhere.


Servers are physical computers, often housed in special server storage facilities where they have high-speed internet. More advanced facilities have fire suppression systems, armed guard, backup power, etc.

To show how important servers are, lets look at how you could host a website from your bedroom - [[Run a server in your bedroom]].


# Choosing a hosting provider
There are many, many hosting providers out there, shop around to find a good one and do your research to make sure they are reputable.


## Shared VS Managed Hosting

There are different types of hosting available such as
- Shared hosting
- Managed hosting
- VPS hosting
- Dedicated server


The last two aren't as common in the world of [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]], so we'll look at the first two.

The main difference is that Shared hosting is not made for a specific type of website; you could host any one of thousands of website software packages on it, such as Drupal, Joomla, OpenCart, etc. 
Managed hosting on the other hand is usually designed for one piece of web software, and the hosting company 'manages' the hosting by tailoring it to suit this web software.

**Where possible I advise using Managed WordPress hosting.**

### Managed Hosting Providers
[WPMU Dev Hosting](**To show how important servers are, lets look at how you could host a website from your bedroom**) - Starts at $10 per month, great interface, support is excellent.

[Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com) - Starts at $15 per month.  Strange pricing plans but hosting is very good, support is great (it just takes longer for a chat to start than WPMU Dev), and it's excellent if you use their local development tool [[Local by Flywheel]] as they work well together.

[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com) - I haven't used this in years but have heard good things about it.


### Shared Hosting Providers
Sometimes your client
- Wants to go with the cheaper option
- Wants webmail as well (Shared hosting tends to have better webmail than Managed)
- Already has shared hosting
- Likes the look of a certain Shared hosting pro divider 
- Already has their domain registered with a Shared hosting provider and wants to keep all services in the one place


In these cases Shared Hosting is fine, you can run WordPress fine on it.

I recommend using 
[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

Or if you are in Ireland or the UK:
[Hosting Ireland](https://hostingireland.ie)


#### Shared hosting providers to avoid
Shared web hosting always comes with a piece of software called *web hosting control*.
This is the graphical interface that lets you manage things like
- Domains and subdomains
- Email accounts
- Databases

Some providers use a reputable, well-known tool for this, some use ones that are not great and frankly often not up to scratch

**cPanel and Plesk are industry-leading tools and you can't go wrong with them.**
[[cPanel]] is very popular and for good reason, it works well and is easy to use.

Be wary of any provider that doesn't use either of these. I'm sure other good tools exist but often they use poor tools that lack basic features like the ability to compress or decompress ZIP files.

In Ireland I advise steering clear of Blacknight and Register365/Names.co.uk as some of their hosting plans use these sub-par services.


#### What should shared hosting cost?

My most-used provider Hosting Ireland has a 'WordPress' plan that I consider to be good value for money and a good benchmark for shared hosting pricing:
