Digital Security is anything you do to keep your online accounts, data/information, resources/assets, and anything else of importance safe from issues such as
- Accidental or malicious data loss 
- Hackers getting into accounts and causing disruption, stealing assets, personal data, etc.
- Any scenario where you lose access to, or someone gains access to, private/sensitive information or resources.


It is important for anyone who uses the internet to practice good Digital Security, even for personal uses such as personal email and social media accounts. 
That said, this note will focus on digital security for freelancers


# Digital Security for Freelancers
Digital Security is very important in many careers and industries, but it is more important for certain ones; it's likely not as important to a carpenter or rally driver as it is for digital freelancers.

That's because us digital freelancers create most of our value in a digital format. I have to properly protect
- Infrastructure such as hosting accounts, [[DNS]], [[nameservers]], ect
- Login information for websites, web apps, etc
- Private information from clients - passwords, bank info, personal information, etc.

Just as owners of brick and mortar stores have locks on doors, CCTV, alarms, and other methods of defence, freelancers should keep a watchful eye on their digital security.


# Digital Security Practices
## 1. Only give access when necessary
Not everyone on a project needs to be an Owner of a Google Drive folder. Not everyone on a team needs to have an Administrator account on the company [[WordPress website]].

> üîê Only give digital access as and when needed. Restrict access where possible.



## 2. Use strong and unique passwords
Passwords should be **unique**. Never use the same password for anything, even if it's just adding a symbol to the end.

Passwords should be **strong.** 
- Don't use personal info such as birthday, family members, pets, etc.
- ...

best bet is use a password generator :)
I use LastPass to generate and save secure passwords such as
yL5nUVFQmYr@W80&#zCc

### Storing Passwords
Your passwords must be stored safely and securely, otherwise it doesn't matter how unique and strong they are!

There are many good free and paid password managers available online; see what works for you. I am biased towards [[LastPass]] but can't say for sure that it's the best option :)


### Passwords VS Passphrases
#AsOfDMY 24th May 2021, I am looking into whether passphrases are better than passwords. See
[[Passwords VS Passphrases]]

## 3. Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA)
This is a security step where you need to complete a second authentication step to get logged in, typically one of:
- Enter a code from a text
- Enter a code from a 2FA Authenticator app
	- Google Authenticator
	- Authy
	- LastPass Authenticator
- Click a prompt on your phone

The majority of online services today offer some form of 2FA and I **encourage you to enable this for every single service possible**. It is a major security update as even if your password for a service is compromised, an attacker usually won't be able to get into your account without the code from your phone.
(I say 'usually' as I'm vaugely aware of ways 2FA can be cheated but these are very uncommon and you are better off using it wherever possible.)

## 4. Balance Security with Usability
If you go too hard on security and are non-stop entering complex passwords and decrypting files, it can lead to you getting lax with security since it takes up so much time. I think this is more of a risk for large businesses than freelancers, and I'm not saying to go light on security, but if you have to enter a 30 digit password into your computer every 10 minutes, security will become too tedious to maintain.


## 5. Use a VPN
A [[Virtual Private Network ]](VPN) is a service that creates a secure connection between your device and a server that you connect to.

Some people advocate for using these 24/7, I myself generally use one when I'm on WiFi I don't trust such as public WiFi. They are also useful for getting around GeoIP blocks, this is where you cannot access a website or hsoting account from certain countries for security reasons. Sometimes I cannot log into UK hosting from Thailand, I set my VPN to the UK to get around this. 

A VPN protects you from insecure websites, and from malicious hackers trying to scan your network and steal information.

## 6. Keep backups
This is relevant to security because a malicious hacker might delete your data if they gain access to a system. Especially important for web designers and developers as hosting accounts, web software, and other web-related services are all susceptible to hacking at some level. 

There are many solutions for this, I personally use and love [[Dropbox]] as the [[Dropbox Sync]] feature makes it very easy to backup files and have them not take up space on your computer. 

Almost all of my files are in Dropbox; if my Macbook, iPad, and Google Pixel phone exploded into flames right now, I wouldn't lose much data.
