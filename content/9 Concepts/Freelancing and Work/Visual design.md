# Visual design
Knowing code is one thing, knowing design is another -  **can you make a website look great?**

If not - don't worry, anyone can learn to, it just takes time and practice.

There are a gazillion great online resources for [[Responsive Web Design]] that looks good, here are my recommendations:

## Recommendations

[[Non-Designer's Design Book]] - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0133966151)*
Excellent book, it's about visual design in general (from business cards to websites) but it's applicable to web design and the [[CRAP Design]] principles are a must-know for visual design.

[[Don't Make Me Think]] - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=dont+make+me+think&qid=1622347710&s=books&sr=1-1)*
Excellent book on user-interface design for websites that makes it as easy as possible for people to find the info they want and take the action they want on a website (harder to do than it sounds).

[[Flux YouTube Channel]] - [YouTube channel link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN7dywl5wDxTu1RM3eJ_h9Q)
Excellent YouTube channel, he works with Webflow but his 'Free Web Design Course 2020' is well watching for aspiring [[Freelance WordPress Web Design|WordPress web designers]]

[[freeCodeCamp]] - [website link](http://freecodecamp.org/)
The course on 'Applied Visual Design' and the one on 'Responsive Web Design Principles' under 'Responsive Web Design Certification'


Work through those resources, then start playing around with themes from [[Elementor]] and [[Envato Elements]] as these already look great so work on some [[Dummy Website|Dummy Websites]] using these.
