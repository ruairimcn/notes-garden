I think this is good inspiration for a project to take on or a challenge to tackle.
You know your professional field or interest well and hence know or can work out what its problems are.

Solving these problems will likely be great for you, others in the field, and others outside of the field who benefit from it indirectly.

I came across this question in 'The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius' by [[Paul Graham]]
