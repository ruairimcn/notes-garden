# Affinity Software Suite
Affinity Software Suite is made up of three applications:
[[Affinity Photo]]
[[Affinity Publish]]
[[Affinity Designer]]

They are of interest to me because they have a once-off cost of €25 to €50 depending on sales, and they are direct competitors to the Adobe Software suite.

## Comparason with Adobe
Affinity is much cheaper and has a once-off cost. Adobe's full [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Creative Cloud]] suite is €30 to €70 **per month.**

You do get a lot of software in the full Adobe suite, some aren't available as Affinity tools such as Premier Pro video editor, Audition audio editor, etc.
**However there are many tools in the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite that I do not use and am paying for.**

So I have bought all three of Affinity's tools and I will be learning to use them, with a view to ending my Adobe subscription and saving more money :D

#ToDo check when Adobe subscription renews for another year as it is an annual contract.
