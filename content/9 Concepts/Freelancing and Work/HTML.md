HTML is...
Best learned about on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA)

I'll only be lightly covering it here as there are many great resources for learning HTML online.

# Summary
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
The World Wide Web originated with HTML.

With HTML you can tell a web browser what each part of the page is:
- What is a heading: H1, H2, H3 etc
- What text is bold or in italics
- What is media, e.g. photos, videos

Here is a screenshot of Facebook with only HTML, i.e. no [[CSS]] to make it look pretty:

## LEGO Analogy
I like using LEGO as an analogy for coding and web design.

HTML is like basic LEGO building blocks. But they are bland and colourless. 
You can build a house with HTML and it will have identifiable rooms (bedrooms, office, kitchen, etc), but they won't look great - it's not the kind of house you would want to live in.

[[CSS]]  adds colour and style to your LEGO house.

## Wikipedia
[According to Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

*The **HyperText Markup Language**, or **HTML** is the standard [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language") for documents designed to be displayed in a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"). It can be assisted by technologies such as [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") (CSS) and [scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language "Scripting language") such as [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript").

[Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web server") receive HTML documents from a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) or from local storage and [render](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine "Browser engine") the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page") [semantically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web "Semantic Web") and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

[HTML elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element "HTML element") are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Images_and_objects "HTML element") and other objects such as [interactive forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldset "Fieldset") may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [structured documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document "Structured document") by denoting structural [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink"), quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by _tags_, written using [angle brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets "Bracket"). Tags such as `<img />` and `<input />` directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as `<p>` surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.*
