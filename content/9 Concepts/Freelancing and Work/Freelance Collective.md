A **Freelance Collective** is a group of like-minded freelancers who collaborate on projects, share knowledge, resources, and tools, and generally support and assist each other.

The exact form it takes differs from group to group so I'll be focusing on the one I co-founded, [[Propeller Digital]].

# Propeller Digital Freelance Collective
## Intro
Propeller Digital started off as a web design partnership between myself and my friend Oliver Burke. It grew into a five-man group of Irish web designers.
We operate under the umbrella of Propeller Digital, and each have an email like ruairi [at] propellerdigital.ie 
But we are all individual sole traders and ultimately it is up to us to go out and find leads to convert into customers, though we do swap/trade/share some work.

### What we do
- We share bills. e.g. [[Basecamp]] is $99 a month so we split the fee across the Collective as we all use it. Some of us have our own individual bills that we pay and manage ourselves.
- We operate under the one brand. This builds the brand faster as our reputation, network, portfolio, and work processes increase in value faster than it would for any of us as an individual (at least that's the case for now, #AsOfDMY 24th May 2021.)
- We sometimes divide up projects between multiple people, e.g. splitting the workload and the profit 50/50.
- We exchange knowledge, ideas, and processes.** For me this is one of, if not the most valuable part of being in a Freelance Collective. **As we all use WordPress regularly, and as we are all innovative and hence improving how we use it, we have developed a shared system for WordPress web design that gets better every day.
- We handle decisions with a mix of democracy and meritocracy.


### What we don't do
- We are not employees and are hence not salaried/waged, we instead work as contractors. There are no fixed work hours or days; as long as clients are happy and looked after, we don't mind how or when the other members work.
- We don't have any ownership or stake in Propeller Digital; it is simply a business name that I have registered in Ireland. People come and go from the Collective
- We don't have a management structure - no bosses to report to. We work **with ** each other **for** our clients.


## My experience
Being part of a Freelance Collective has been one of the most rewarding parts of my career:
- **It's fun! **We humans are social animals and working on a team is often exciting.
- **It has accellerated my learning and growth.** I've had the good fortune of being able to assemble a group of like-minded, drive, innovative young men to work with together. Our knowledge and skill sharing down the years has kept my growth and development in constant motion.
-** I enjoy teaching others.** Sharing my knowledge with others is something I enjoy a lot and will be doing a lot more of going forward. And I enjoy being taught too! The Mentor-Mentee role was often flipped and switched as we all learned new and varying skills.


## Are You Going Freelance?
If you are planning on going freelance, or just contemplating it, it's worth considering joining or starting a Freelance Collective. They might not work for everyone but I personally have found my one to be an excellent vehicle for improvement personally and professionally. Freelancing can be lonely and a Collective is a good antidote to that.

Were I not a part of one, I would have found it much more difficult to go on my recent 10 day meditation retreat - see [[May 2021 Pa Pae Meditation Retreat]]. The other four members of Propeller Digital covered for me when issues arose.
