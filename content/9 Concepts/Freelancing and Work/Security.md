Digital security has become more and more important over the years as technology has become a bigger aspect of doing business.

It is of even more importance to 'virtual first' businesses who have a lot of data and infrastructure on the net.

To that end, I advise we do the following:

**Actionable Security Items:**
1. Use secure passwords
2. Change passwords every quarter
3. Use Two Factor Authentication
4. Use a VPN
5.  Keep backups
6.  Encrypt devices


**Security Principles:**
1. Give the minimum access possible 
2. Balance usability with security
3. Treat digital assets like physical ones.




# Actionable Security Items:

## 1: Use secure passwords 

Passwords should be strong, either a 
**Random password:** Random letters, numbers and symbols. Ideally 12 to 20 characters.
**Random passphrase:** Three to four random uppercase words with a number thrown in for good measure, e.g.: SnowPigeonSpeakerMat8
Handy for passwords you need to remember, e.g. laptop password. 

BitWarden is a password manager that I've begun using, it generates random passwords and saves them. i.e. you only need to remember your BitWarden password as it will store the rest.


## 2: Change passwords every quarter
Ideally our passwords would be updated every quarter.



## 3: Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA)
This is a security step where you need to complete a second authentication step to get logged in, typically one of:
- Enter a code from a text
- Enter a code from a 2FA Authenticator app
	- Google Authenticator
	- Authy
	- LastPass Authenticator
- Click a prompt on your phone

The majority of online services today offer some form of 2FA and I **recommend we enable this for every single service possible**. It is a major security feature as even if your password for a service is compromised, an attacker usually won't be able to get into your account without the code from your phone.
(I say 'usually' as I'm vaugely aware of ways 2FA can be cheated but these are very uncommon and you are better off using it wherever possible.)



## 4: Use a VPN
A [[Virtual Private Network ]](VPN) is a service that creates a secure connection between your device and a server that you connect to.

Some people advocate for using these 24/7, I myself generally use one when I'm on WiFi I don't trust such as public WiFi. They are also useful for getting around GeoIP blocks, this is where you cannot access a website or hsoting account from certain countries for security reasons. Sometimes I cannot log into UK hosting from Thailand, I set my VPN to the UK to get around this. 

A VPN protects you from insecure websites, and from malicious hackers trying to scan your network and steal information.


## 5: Keep backups
This is relevant to security because a malicious hacker might delete your data if they gain access to a system. Especially important for web designers and developers as hosting accounts, web software, and other web-related services are all susceptible to hacking at some level. 

There are many solutions for this, I personally use and love [[Dropbox]] as the [[Dropbox Sync]] feature makes it very easy to backup files and have them not take up space on your computer. 

Almost all of my files are in Dropbox; if my Macbook, iPad, and Google Pixel phone exploded into flames right now, I wouldn't lose much data. 


## 6: Encrypt Devices
Most devices come with a simple setting that encrypts the device when it is turned off, and decrypts it when it is turned on. It prevents your data being stolen in the event that your device is stolen.

Ensure you keep your encryption password somewhere safe


# Security Principles:



## 1: Give the minimum access possible 
Don't give people more access to a system than they need; only give them the permissions required to do their job properly.



## 2: Balance Security with Usability
If we go too hard on security and are non-stop entering complex passwords and decrypting files, it can lead to one getting lax with security since it takes up so much time. I think this is more of a risk for large businesses than freelancers, and I'm not saying to go light on security, but if you have to enter a 30 digit password into your computer every 10 minutes, security will become too tedious to maintain.


## 3: Treat digital assets like physical ones.
Just as the owner of a physical store locks up at night, employs a security firm, monitors the alarm and installs cameras, so should we proactively monitor and secure our digital assets.
