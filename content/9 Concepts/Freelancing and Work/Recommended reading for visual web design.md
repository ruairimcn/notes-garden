I recommend reading the following books to upskill in visual web design:

[[Don't Make Me Think]] - Excellent book on User Interface and User Experience design for the web.
[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=dont+make+me+think&qid=1621674990&sr=8-1)

[[The Non-Designers Design Book]] - Excellent book on the basics of design: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity [[CRAP Design]]
[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Non-Designers-ebook/dp/B00PWDFWEE/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1621675040&sr=8-1)


And the lessons on [[freeCodeCamp]] covering [Applied Visual Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#applied-visual-design) is great too.
