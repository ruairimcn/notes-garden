I think that people, in particular the younger generation, are being subtly tricked into thinking shortcuts exist where in fact there are none.

I believe this is a by-product of living in [[The age of instant gratification]] where almost everything is available on demand:
- Spotify has all the songs you could want
- Netflix and similar services are packed with TV shows and movies to watch
- Deliveroo, Uber Eats, etc, can bring any kind of food right to your front door

and so on and so forth.

You might have seen ads on YouTube or elsewhere online where
- Someone is crying with tears of happiness at having $10,000 in their account after 3 days of signing up to 'some cool new ingenious easy way to make money'
- Someone is telling you they have an easy system for making money fast
- Someone is selling you on some kind of shortcut


However, markets are structured in such a way that there are few to no shortcuts available for acumulating wealth. And you can't accumulate knowledge without doing the work.
I believe that
> ðŸ’¡ There are no shortcuts to gaining wealth and knowledge. You must work hard and smart.

That being said there are some shortcuts but they are absolutely unreliable:
- Winning the lotto
- Receiving an unexpected inheritance
- Getting lucky in the stock market (this is a different story if you study investing as a skill and can reliably turn a profit)
- Getting lucky in the casion

I personally won't be pursing the above - that leaves my time, energy, and vision as the way to accumulate money and knowledge. I also follow the principle of [[Investing in yourself first]].

So, given that hard and smart work is required, it's all the more important that you enjoy your work, that you work on [[Finding a skill you love doing]].
