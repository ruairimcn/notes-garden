# Online VS Local Hosting

When you are working on a new WordPress website (e.g. a work-in-progress/development website for a client), you have the option of  hosting it online, or locally.

## Pros and Cons Table
| Online                                                                                                 | Offline                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Have to pay hosting fee                                                                                | Free                                                                                                                                             |
| Have to be connected to the internet to make changes                                                   | Can work offline                                                                                                                                 |
| Easier to deploy finished website if you developed it on the hosting account where it will be launched | Extra launch step of getting website online, can sometimes have issues if offline hosting environment is different to online hosting environment |
| Easier to share progress with client                                                                   | Harder to share progress with client, doable with [[Local by Flywheel]] but your computer has to be online for clients to view it. Can work around this by using [[Local by Flywheel]] to push the work-in-progress site to staging website if hosting is with [[Flywheel]].                                                                                                                                                 |


I personally almost always opt for online as I'm almost always have internet access, and I like the ease of sharing it with clients. 

Sometimes I work on websites together with another member of [[Propeller Digital]] and we need it online in this case.
