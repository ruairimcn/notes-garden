freeCodeCamp is an excellent free online course on a number of coding topics. The ones I'm interested in for the purpose of teaching people to make a living from [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]] are
- Responsive Web Design
	-  [[HTML]]
	- [[CSS]]
	- Visual Design
- Basic  [[Javascript]]


The course is comprehensive and gives you an example or challenge for every lesson in the cirriculum, which gets you practicing straight away.

For the flavour of [[Freelance WordPress Web Design]] that I teach, I advise doing the lessons under [[Responsive Web Design]], maybe even do this a 2nd time, and try your hand at coding and publishing a Bootstrap HTML/CSS/JS personal website/blog, or a mock design for your potential future web design career.

Javascript isn't as important for now, but can be very powerful if you cet to grips with it. You can try your hand at the Basic lessons for now, or just revisit then later. They are good for improving your problem solving in general so they are worth a shot!
