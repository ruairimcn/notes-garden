A 31 minute video giving an overview of the world economy by [[Ray Dalio]].

# Intro
A lack of understanding and agreement on how the economy works has caused a lot of suffering and problems.

Ray's model is unconventional and simple, and it has served him well for over 30 years. 

It might seem complex, but the economy works in a simple, mechanical way. 


The economy is made up of many many transactions that are driven by human nature. This creates three main forces that drive the economy: 
1. Productivity growth
2. Short term debt cycle
3. Long term debt cycle 




# Transactions
An economy is the sum of the transactions that make it up.
A transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for good, services, or financial assets.

Credit spends just like money, so
Money + Credit = Total Spending

The Total Spending drives the economy.

Total Price / Total Quantity = Price

This is the building block of the economic machine; al cycles and all forces are driven by transactions, so if we understand them we can understand the whole economy.



# Markets
A market consists of all the buyers and sellers making transactions for the same thing.
- Wheat market
- Steel market
- Car market
- Video game market
- Stock market


An economy is the sum of all transactions in all markets. If you know the total spending and total quantity in all markets, you have all the info needed to understand the economy. 


# Government
A government is usually the biggest buyer and seller.
A government is made up of two important parts:
1. Central Government that collects and spends taxes
2. Central Bank controls the amount of money and credit in the economy, by controlling interest rates and printing new money. 




# Credit
Central Banks control the amount of credit in the country. Credit is the most important part of the economy because it is the biggest and most volatile part. It is typically the least understood part of the  economy.

Lenders want to turn their money into more money, and Borrowers want to buy something they cannot afford, like a house or a car. 
Credit can help both parties to get what they want.

Borrowers agree to repay the original amount (Principal) plus a fee (Interest) in the future.

When interest rises, borrowing decreases as it's more expensive. When interest lowers, borrowing increases as it's cheaper. 

When a borrower wants to take out a loan and the lender believes they will pay it back, credit is created. Any two parties can create credit out of thin air.

As soon as credit is created, it becomes debt. 
Debt is an asset to the lender and a liability to the borrower. 
When the borrower repays the principal plus interest, the debt and credit disappear and the transaction is settled. 

**Credit is important because it increases the borrowers spending, and their spending is income for a seller. **

A creditworthy borrower (someone who lenders are happy to give credit to) has two things:
1. The ability to repay (a lot of income in relation to the debt)
2. Collateral if he can't repay (Valuable assets to sell)

These two things make lenders comfortable loaning money. 
> Increased income allows increased borrowing allows increased spending. And since one person's spending is another's income, a self-reinforcing pattern is created leading to economic growth, but also creating cycles. 



# Economic Cycles
In transactions we have to give to get, and how much we can get depends on how much we produce.

Over time we learn and that increased knowledge improved our living standards. This is called **productivity growth**.

Those who are inventive and hard working raise their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy. But this is a long-term effect; credit matters more in the short-run. This is because productivity growth doesn't fluctuate much, so it doesn't cause big economic swings. Debt is because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we get it, and forces us to consume less than we produce when we have to pay it back.  

> Economic Cycles are primarly driven by credit, not productivity and/or innovation. More credit = boom, less credit = bust.

There are two main debt cycles:
1. Short-term, 5-8 years.
2. Long-term, 75-100 years

Most people see of feel the swings but are unaware that they are cycles because they don't see the big picture as they are too engrossed in the day-to-day and week-to-week cycles of life, never looking from a higher place at the years and decades.

In a world with no credit, only productivity can cause growth. The economy only grows when people are more productive.

But we do have credit; we borrow and hence have cycles due to
1) Human nature
2) The nature of credit/borrowing


## Borrowing and Credit
Borrowing is essentially a way of pulling spending forward by borrowing from your future self. This creates a time in the future when you will need to spend less than you earn to pay back the owed debt. **A cycle is created every time we borrow - a mechanical, predictable series of events.**

Credit differs from money as money is used to settle transactions.

**Most of the money in the world economy is credit**
There is $50 trillion credit VS $3 trillion cash in the USA.

Credit is not inherently bad. 
It is good when it allows you to earn more money by efficiently allocating resources or producing income, e.g. buying better farm equipment, and bad when it is used to finance over-consumption that can't be paid back, e.g. flatscreen TV. 


### Growth via credit
1. You earn $100,000 annually and have no debt. This allows you to take out a loan of $10,000.
2. You can now spend $110,000, and as your spending is someone elses income, someone else earns $110,000, can borrow $11,000, and spend $121,000. 
3. And so on and so forth.



## Short Term Debt Cycle
When incomes and spending rise faster than production (spending is greater than goods produced), prices rise. This is **inflation.**

The Central Banks don't like inflation as it causes problems (* #Question: what problems?*). It can reduce inflation by raising interest rates, which causes less borrowing and hence less spending as interest repayments are now higher. **And since one person's spending is another's income, we have deflation and a recession.** If the recession becomes too severe and inflation is no longer a problem, the Central Bank will lower interest rates, causing everything to pick up again.

With lower interest rates, more people will borrow more money and we have growth again. 

In this short cycle, *growth is only limited by lenders and borrowers appetite for borrowing and lending.*

This cycle is primarly controlled by the Central Banks. 

We have  growth from this cycle as the start and end (bottom and top) of each cycle is a little higher up than the previous one as **people tend to push it:** they are inclined to borrow more instead of paying back debt, so even though growth/GDP rises, **total debt rises too.**


## Long Term Debt Cycle
Even though debt is rising amongst borrowers, lenders are still happy to give credit because the economy is seen to be booming and everyone wants a piece of it. They focus on what has been happening recently:
People are buying new things, the stock market is on the rise, etc. Assets are more valuable so more and more people are taking out loans to purchase assets and to get a return on them over time.

- More income
- More valuable assets
- More borrowing.

> ⚠️ Bubble Alert!


### Debt Burden
The ratio of Debt to Income is called the Debt Burden.
So long as incomes continue to rise, the debt burden stays manageable. 

Rising incomes and asset values help to keep borrowers creditworthy despite rising debt.

Over decades the levels of debt rise and creditworthiness decereases. Eventually they grow faster than incomes, and people reduce their spending.
**And since one person's spending is another person's income,** the cycle reverses and it all begins to decline.
