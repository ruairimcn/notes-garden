- Control the center of the board throughout the game, in all phases
- No more than six pawn moves in first fourteen move of the game. Think carefully before moving pawns as they can't be moved back
- Develop pieces quickly, try not to move the same piece multiple times in the opening 
- Castle early. Protects king and brings rook closer to center
- Don't move queen too early, gives opponent time by attacking it 
- Connect your rooks (protecting each other)
