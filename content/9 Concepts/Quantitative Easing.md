**According to Wikipedia:**
Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy whereby a central bank purchases predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to inject money into the economy to expand economic activity. Quantitative easing is considered to be an unconventional form of monetary policy, which is usually used when inflation is very low or negative, and when standard monetary policy instruments have become ineffective.


# According to Investopedia:
Quantitative easing (QE) is a form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases longer-term securities from the open market in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. Buying these securities adds new money to the economy, and also serves to lower interest rates by bidding up fixed-income securities. It also expands the central bank's balance sheet.

Increasing the supply of money lowers [[Interest rates]], allowing banks to lend with easier terms. 

QE is usually implemented when interest rates are near zero as central banks.

## Special considerations
Increasing the money supply (e.g. via QE) can cause inflation. The worst scenario with QE is that the QE strategy causes inflation without the intended economic growth. This is called stagflation.

QE is not always guaranteed to work as central banks cannot force borrowers to seek loans and to invest, and they cannot force banks to increase their lending activities.
