The Nested Egg is a teaching method taught in the book [[Brain-centric Design]].

It is straightforward, efficient, simple, and works every time (according to the authors!).

Is is **backwards design.**

# Structure 
## The Big Idea
[[The Big Idea BcD]]
This is the one core idea that we use to anchor the rest of the information that we want to teach. 

We first need to find The Big Idea, and this can be done by using [[Backward Design]]. 


### Locating The Big Idea
(See the book [[Brain-centric Design]] for the full example)

1. Created a nested egg. Draw a circle and label it "BIG IDEA", then draw and egg/oval around the circle and label it "Nice to Know".
2. Pretend you're teaching a class about the importance of sleep. Ask yourself "*What would I like the learner to know about the topic?*". Write those items on sticky notes, one per item. Try to break up longer sentences/ideas into two or more items.
	This might look like
		- Go to bed at the same time each night
		- Get up at the same time each morning
		- Sleep consists of 4-5 cycles
		- You sleep best in a dark, quiet room
		- etc...
	To a behaviorist, with a little tweaking and re-arranging, a long list of items like would comprise the full presentation. But to go into detail on each item would take too long, especially given [[On average our short-term memory limit is four items plus or minus two]].
3. To "BcD" the info, chunk the content into similar categories. Then move this chunked info into the "Nice to Know" ring on our chart. 
4. Pick out one concept you believe is the most important for the learner to understand - **just one!** This is critical - more than one and the learner will be much more likely to end up confused, due to the limits of working memory. We are constrained both by teaching session time limit, and the cognitive demands of the material. 
	*"If the learner only takes away one item from the Nice to Know pile, what should it be? "*
	Place this idea in the middle circle, label it the Big Idea.
5. Ask the following questions:
	1. Does the Big Idea relate to Me Here Now?
	2. Can I frame the Big Idea in a way that directly relates to the learner?
	3. How can I make it more engaging? 
6. **Choose your Two Scaffolding Constructs.** Ask "What items does the learner need to understand from the Nice to Know pile in order to appreciate why they shouldn't look at their phones before bed?"
	The [[On average our short-term memory limit is four items plus or minus two|Rule of four plus or minus two]] indicates that most learners max out at two concepts, so the recommendation is two scaffolding constructs that assist with processing the Big Idea. *They should be different enough to require separate processing, but should both related to the Big Idea.*
7. Label the two constructs *Need to Know*.


# Benefits
- Helps to prioritize understanding by deciding what is important; keep the vegetables and remove the weeds. 
- By changing the Big Idea from something abstract ("Avoid bright lights") to something practical ("Why you shouldn't look at your cell phone before bed"), the learner can directly see how the info will impact them, which promotes [[Intrinsic Motivation]].



# Measuring success
Stand at the door as your audience leaves and ask them what they took away from the class; if it's not the Bid Idea, you know you need to revise. This is called [[Formative Assessment]] in a classroom: ensuring that what is being understood by the learner is what the teacher had intended.
