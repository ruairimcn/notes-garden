I am always looking for solutions to [[The Modern Problem MoC]]; ways to live a more natural life that is more in line with our hunter-gatherer brains and bodies.

Creating an outdoor office is one solution, particularly to the problem of trying to [[Spend More Time in Nature]].


So, I brought a desk outside to my porch to spend more time in nature!


## Pros and cons
There are many advantages to this setup (mostly to do with the health benefits listed at the start), and the only real disadvantage for me personally is that I try to spend as much time as possible at my standing desk. But I can simply split my time between the two, and can go inside to the standing desk if it's too hot or wet outside. 
**Update:** I moved my standing desk outside :) See below.

## Outdoor Office Evolution
#AsOfDMY 25th May 2021, I have moved my [[Standing desk]] outside.
I spent a week mostly working outside and really enjoyed it, to the point that I didn't want to go back to being boxed in by four walls and a roof!

So I got out a screwdriver and moved my standing desk outside.

- I move everything inside at night when I'm done, except the desk itself which I push back into the corner of the porch, to keep it from getting wet as it has electronic components (motorised desk instead of a crank/winch).
- It's quiet enough that I can do calls outside.
- I don't forsee many needs to go inside - unless a monster rain storm comes. In which case I have sitting desks inside the house and I can carry the standing desk inside quickly with my girlfriend's help if needed (do not underestimate the strength of small Thai women ðŸ¤£)


Here is a view from the other side to show you the porch space:

## Making a MVP
An MVP is a business term meaning [[Minimum Viable Product]].
But it can be applied in other parts of life too.
In this case it means I did the bare minimum setup needed to effectively work outside.
Previously I had been considering making plastic panels/sheets that I can lower around the sides of this sitting area shown below in my front garden, as this area isn't as sheltered from rain.

But after some thinking I realized I can just move a light â‚¬15 sittting desk to the porch. And having used that for a week I took the next step, which was spending an hour taking apart, moving, and assembling a â‚¬500 standing desk.
