# Technique
Start by placing the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue behind your upper front teeth.
1. Breath in through nose for a count of four, quietly.
2. Hold the breath for a count of seven
3. Breath out through mouth for a count of eight, audibly.
4. Repeat


The book [[Breath]] recommends 5.5 seconds on the inhale, 5.5 seconds on the exhale. Combined with the pause, we can average 3 breaths a minute.
