Based on what I've learned abut [[Dopamine]], largely from [[Andrew Huberman]] and the book [[Dopamine Nation]], I think it's best to avoid high dopamine activities and substances.

I was thinking about how with someone who has done meth, and someone who hasn't, the former will probably enjoy, say, [[Yoga MoC]] less because their expectation for dopamine from activities has been raised much higher, since, in rats, meth raises dopamine above their baseline by about 1,000x; they now know what this much dopamine feels like and will want more.
