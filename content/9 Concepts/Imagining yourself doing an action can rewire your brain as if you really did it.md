Research into [[Neuroplasticity]] by Pascual-Leone shows that the mere act of imagining oneself doing a certain task can rewire the brain as if the task was physically done.

Leone created two groups of people with no experience playing the piano, and taught them a simple melody.

One group practiced the melody on a keyboard for two hours a day over the next five days.

The other group sat in front of a keyboard for the same amount of time but only imagined playing the song - they never touched the keys.

Using [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), Leone mapped the brain activity of all participants before, during, and after the test.

**The people who only imagined playing the keyboard had the same changes in their brains as the ones who pressed the keys.**
Their brains had changed *in response to to actions that took place purely in their imagination.*
